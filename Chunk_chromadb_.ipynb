- what are you investigating?- is tatsumura involved? there are rumors that sanritsuindustries is behind all this. isn't its president tatsumurathe mastermind behind this incident? aren't you flooded with complaints aboutpolice ineffectiveness in the case? they say the authorities are toocautious, or worse, weak-kneed. i'll ask you the same question:what do you guys think? it's easy to criticize others. but are you trying to bring backthe old, heavy-handed police power? it's not as if cautiousinvestigation is bad. and that's part of thedifficulty of this job. it's not you who's been getting yourmen killed at every turn, it's me. oh, hi. the press? yeah. i got a little excited. i went to the farewell ceremonyfor detective sugiyama. i see. well. that's three in a row. - what a shame.- yeah. and...the meeting? it's like we've hit a dead end. we don't have a concrete plan. all the violent incidentsin this neighborhood are connected tosanritsu industries. i'm sure i'm onthe right track, but i don't know where to startto catch them by the tail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 we don't have a single clue. we're helpless. it's our own faultthat the city is calling us weak-kneed. the three men who diedwould turn in their graves. sanritsu industriesbusiness information chairman saichi sakurapresident j\\u00e5\\u00aago tatsumura i just had an idea. i heard a rumor on the street. tatsumura has recently takencomplete control of the organization. they say things are gettingawkward with his uncle, sakura. mmm-hmm... so? if we can crack the organization bysuccessfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get someclues for the investigation. i see. but that would require-- of course.we can't do it alone. we really need the help of a manknowledgeable about the organization. mmm-hmm. a kind of guerrilla operation. interesting idea, but i don't know if there's anybodywho could be that useful. i actually have a littlebit of an idea about that. oh? who is it? tojima brothers hello! hello! coming! oh! old man! hi. hi. welcome. - are you two working together?- no. she wouldn't stop askingme to show her how to fix it. boy, you look terrible! oh! did you have the ceremony yet? no, not yet. it seems rather sillyto call it a wedding now, but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - we'll invite you when we do, mr. ogata.- sure. - please come in.- okay. it looks like two more cars have beenadded after not coming here for a while. but the two drivers are unavailable,so they're just like decorations now. - please have a seat.- okay. hard-working, kind-hearted\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 she'll make a good wife. yeah... i suppose so. so, what broughtyou here today? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 it's kind of hard to saywhat i'm asking you to do. actually, i just wanted to askyou to go back to the old you. - the old me?- yes. a yakuza. old man, don't jokearound with me. i wouldn't joke aboutasking you to do this. please... i really need your help! what's the story? you want me to be a g-man. you're no strangerto tatsumura. i would like to ask you to do this. and let me assure you, this isn't about saving theface of the police or anything. we have to crush that germ-likeorganization as soon as possible. old man, if you want to talk about that,please take it up with someone else. i'm asking because i knowi can count on you. it's not a job thatjust anybody can do. don't give me too much credit. i'm not that respectable. but-- first of all, i don't want to doanything that'll open old wounds. okay. maybe i shouldn't haveasked you to do it. why don't you get outof this business? i'd be happy tohelp you find a job. it would be my pleasure. but i'm a man with no education at all living only for this jobsince i was a simple police officer. the grime sticks anddoesn't seem to come off. i might have to die to get it clean. i'm sorry i can't help you. it's okay. i'll definitelyattend your wedding. yeah. bye. oh? is mr. ogatagoing home already? - yes.- oh. what was that about? it has nothing to do with us. yes, this is tojimatransport co. huh? what's up? it's the usual\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - hello.- how's it going? are you ready toaccept our protection? i refuse. i don't wantto be under your care. think carefully about it. without a driver there wouldn'tbe any business, you know. what? what did he say this time? don't worry about it. huh? the car's back. oof! brother! - osamu!- osamu! what's wrong? he said he gotjumped by thugs. - thugs?- yeah. - let's go inside to treat the wound.- yes. so when did you get out? today. i was on my way here. i was surprised to see that thetruck was marked \\\"tojima transport\\\"! boss, i'm quitting. no matter how many livesi have, it won't be enough. what are you saying? the two guys taking a break musthave gone through the same thing i did. you can't tell usto fight the yakuza. let's do it, bro!i can help you! to be honest, i'm disappointedthat you quit the business. osamu... what have you learnedfrom four years in juvie? i'm not going to fight. i'm going now because they'reprobably waiting for me. you're free to quit. you can take yoursalary up to today. bro! bro! i'm disappointed in you, bro. where's the brotherthat i used to know? i'm sure he wouldn't just sit backand let this happen to him! idiot! damn it! you're not my brother! osamu! don't talk to yourbrother like that. - take care of yourself.- thank you. but, you know, don't youthink it's frustrating? when you'reprovoked like that-- it's frustrating, but we'll be out ofbusiness if we take on every fight. we're not selling fights. but you were the boss's daughter.you should understand how i feel. i've forgotten, you know, the old days. both your brother and i. suit yourself. no wonder my brotherbecame a coward. his wife's too beautifuland too decent. sassy little thing,aren't you? you should look beforeyou say something weird. tojima brothers you see? this business belongsto you and your brother. damn it. my brother, he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 your brother was really lookingforward to you getting out. you have to understand. we're half-brothers. we're not meant to be likeother brothers in the world. what are you talking about? i'll throw you a welcomehome party tonight. what's your favorite thing? what do you want to eat? osamu? osamu!where are you going? who was it? who was it? who did this? - mr. jo.- boss! - this is my car.- what? i parked it on the cornerover there, and it's\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 that's right. why is this happening again? shall i take care of this? mind your own business.leave me alone. don't say that. you need our protection in casethings like this happen. right? - that means you guys are--- boss! anyway, let's go in. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6they've even come toyour business for protection money? if they know the old you, they wouldn'tbe able to do something stupid like that. well, go ahead. sorry. because of my mess,even your store is-- no, actually, my businessis being blackmailed, too. you too, jo? yeah. in the beginningthey called me to invite me. when i refused, the thugs came. i told 'em to look people in the eyewhen talking and threw 'em out. and here we are today. you didn't report itto the police, did you? yeah, i thought about that. but if the cops are there allday long, no customers will come. they predictedthat much, all right. do you know which groupthe thugs belonged to? they belong to the takedafamily down the street. i think sanritsu industries is themastermind behind the protection racket. i heard that thetakeda family's boss became a shareholder ofsanritsu industries the other day. i think that's fishy. i didn't know that. a champion, huh?

they're all gone. how did that happen? well... a series of disturbancesthe other night, you know, bartenders running away,waitresses being taken\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 even the debt was takenover by sanritsu industries. the former championis no longer in shape! i'll give them all to thatbastard tatsumura! i'll explain later, but i wantyou to come to my place tonight. hey, sis! my brother's back! honey, those people havecome to pick up the truck. did you really sell it? yeah, we've alreadymade the deal. please take it! hey, why are you doing this?what are we going to do now? i'm sorry to break it to you, but i've decided togo back to my old life. what? you'll have to live in theapartment for a while. that's the brother i know! sorry, but there's a world of men thatwomen don't understand. right, bro? you go live with her.and get a job. that's stupid! please, please don't do it. did you forget whathappened four years ago? didn't you almost die tryingto crawl out of the muck? don't get desperate just becausethings aren't working here. we can go somewherewhere there are no yakuza. please, please don't do it. i'm sorry, but i'vemade up my mind. this time i'm goingto do it my way. that's right!that's right, brother! but you can't do it alone, bro.hey, please, let me do it. i'll bring my friendsif you want. idiot! i said no, you can't do it. pack your bags with her. i've now given youthe gist of it. i'd really like somehelp from you all. i just want to assure you thatwe're subcontracting for the police. it's low-pay despite the risk. i'd like to know if you'restill willing to take it on. please don'thesitate to tell me. when you say subcontracting forthe police, how will you start? first i'll pretend to makea comeback to the yakuza. then i'll infiltrate their organizationunder the guise of a turf war. that would meanwe're the tojima family. gentlemen, this is theperfect role for you. if you look in the mirrori think you'll see what i mean. i don't want to flatter you, buti'd hardly call you all good citizens. but it takes a hell of a lot ofguts and horsepower to hit them. you're all perfect teammembers in that regard. hey, bro, even though it's police work,we're putting our lives on the line. there will be a littlereward, won't there? i can't guarantee that. i'm sure you'llmanage it just fine. but don't forget there'sa policeman next to you. so let's hear your answer. can you guys give me a hand? let's show them what we can do! i'll get tatsumura backfor his protection racket. how about you, matsushima? well, i'm being askedto take care of the car. i don't see anyoneelse qualified. goro? i'll do my best tosave the extra money. mr. policeman? it's my duty soi'll do whatever-- you scared me! - osamu!- brother... don't treat me like a stranger! everyone, i'm hisbrother, osamu kaji. we're actually half-siblings. how many timeshave i told you? i'm not gonnamake you one of us. again with that.i wish you'd trust me. but a goofball like youwould be the first to get hit. i can't take careof a guy like that. well, then, brother.you mean you can't-- you'd be slowing me down.give it up. fine, then!i'll do my own thing! osamu... osamu! he's just like you the way he won'tback out of something once he's said it. he's a real pain in the ass. so everything isokay then, right? okay, now let's get to work. first you'll go out and spread wordthat i'm making a comeback. tojima brothers \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by pistol. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by tommy gun. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by dynamite. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa everybody, everybodydisappears in a puff of smoke \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa with water. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when the blood lefton the bed dries up \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa there, i hear it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that rhythm \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa sing it! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa dance all you want! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa jam session on anenchanting night \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa i'm drunk and i'm all alone \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa may i sit here? if you don't mindme sitting with you. would you like tobuy me a drink? in return, you tell mewhose territory this is. you sure aren'ttight-lipped, are you? i'll have what he's having. i hear a retired yakuza namedtojima is making a comeback. well. i'm sure there willbe an uproar now. i don't thinktatsumura will allow it. but tojima and tatsumuramust have been like brothers. people only think that's true. they don't get alongwith each other very well. i'm telling you thisfor your own good. if you want to make a living as ayakuza, it's smarter to join tatsumura. thanks for the advice. if you want, i can askthe higher-ups for you. did tatsumura ask youto scout for the yakuza? huh? you'll have to ask tatsumura if you can hirea guy named tojima. then you're\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 next time you see me,call me tojima. recreation center construction who are you? you almost got yourself killed. do you know what'sgoing on here? i do, but thanks anyway. don't get me wrong. i'm here to kill you.don't move! do you recognize this face? five years ago\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 five years ago? in a turf war on the beach,you shot a guy named kuroki. then you're kuroki's-- i'm his younger brother. now that you remember,i'm going to kill you. wait! that wasn't supposedto be a fatal injury. no respectable doctorwould've treated that wound. it's no wonder it was fatal. i made a vow then. i swore i'd kill youif i ever saw you! are you hurt? you think you saved me? that doesn't make upfor my brother! wait a minute! i get how you feel, buti've got a job i've got to do. i won't let you stop me. - boss, are you hurt?- i'm fine. the advertisement worked 100%. i've already gota lot of sponsors. that's the guy. him? a debt is a debt. i'll wait untilyour job is done. in exchange, i'm not leavingyour side for a while. i won't let you dieuntil it's by my hand. so you're a bodyguard. well, okay. he's an old friend of mine.try to get along. starting tomorrowwe're going to be busy. sanritsu industries boss, tojima is here. what do you want to do? i thought they'dbe here by now. hey. to what do we owethis surprise? it's been a while. how's your shippingcompany doing? i heard you were happy togetherwith the previous boss's daughter. i don't think i can makea living as an honest man. i'm going backto the old tojima. i see. that's why you came allthe way out here to say hello. shimadzu. let's celebratetojima's comeback. book a welcome home party-- you already threw mea welcome home party. a fancy one with lead bullets. i know it was supposedto be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. tojima.... you've become nastierliving as an honest man. i'm not as bad as you. you took over this buildingin less than four years? i was hoping you'd tell mehow to make money. that's the kind of advice one canonly get from a professional. i wish you'd stopwith the innuendos. sanritsu industriesis a legitimate company. and we pay our taxes. if you want, you cango ask the tax office. but i hear there's a lot of money to bemade without the tax office knowing. what do you mean? for example...protection rackets. that sort of workfits these guys. don't move! what's this? a raccoon dog's tail? i'm the one who built all this. i have some allies,but also many enemies. you can never be too careful. everyone, leave us. i think it's time tocut to the chase. i'm being extorted, it seems. no, i just need a little help. it's a lot of work to make upfor four years of absence. i'd like to borrow your territoryfor a while, for old time's sake. sorry, i don't have anythinglike that right now. i have enough to eat running atheater and a recreation center. oh yeah? that's a relief. then i'll make my ownterritory without reservation. that's all well and good,but be careful. they say once a boxer retires,he never makes a comeback again. jinxes can be brokensomeday, you know. well, look forward to it. i see. tojima has shown up so now tatsumura hasmore things to worry about. that's why he tried toget rid of him last night. that was a screw-up,out of character for tatsumura. i'm getting lucky. it's good to live a long time. you've pit the two against eachother for your own advantage? i'm the one who originally createdsanritsu industries, after all. i didn't want to keep it intatsumura's care forever. so... shall we propose the election of a newpresident at the next general meeting? no, i think we'll waitand see what tojima does. - chairman!- hmm? mr. tojima has cometo say hello to you. good thing he came now. have him come over here. mr. chairman,it's been a while. yeah, a while. i hear youmade a comeback the other day. yeah. i'll needyour help again. yeah, sure. but now i'mpractically retired. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 i heard a rumor that you'll be returningas president of sanritsu once again. there are too manyirresponsible rumors out there. i agree. i was even gossipingwith tatsumura just now. with tatsumura? they sayyou had a dispute last night. that's just anotherirresponsible rumor. but you better be careful. it's weird saying thisto your face, i've always preferred youto tatsumura. if you ever need help,i'm always here for you. oh. i'll see you, then. well, i'll leave youalone for today. this is a fine housefor an old fox's nest. and they're even planningto expand the place. sanritsu industries i see. that old manand tojima, huh? i think we can still dosomething about it now. you're something yourself too. what are you after? the sakura family's territory? well, if that's on the table. okay. i'll grant you that. in exchange, get to work. eliminate the old man. boss. he's your blood relative. i don't remember havingan uncle like that. murakami. take the kijima brothers. mr. chairman. these men say that theycame from tatsumura. what do they want? can't you handle it yourself? no, i definitely can't. what are you doing?stop it, you! chairman of sanritsuindustries murdered killing anyone whogets in the way? but this is too much! this is exactly howtatsumura works. now their organizationis strengthened again. we have to find anew way to get inside. welcome. can iget you a drink? i don't have any money.here, let me pay with this. we're supposed to ask for cash. don't be so uptight. i heard whoserestaurant this is. welcome. eh? are you the onei need to talk to? maybe. we'll see. boy, where are you from? check the family register.no comment. well?! i want a clear answer! come this way. here. the pistol. wait here. manager's office i have someonewe could use. we heard your story. - go home for today.- what? we have to check if the gunhas been used in a crime. if you can't tell by holding it,then you're an amateur. what? that gun isn't loaded. you're not qualifiedto be a bouncer. move! are you the boss? if you really want to workhere, do as you're told. waving that thing aroundwon't get you anywhere. got it? got it. nice to meet you. the takeda family controlsthe bar area here. the bars and cabarets in this areaare the yoshi family's territory. both are backed bysanritsu industries, i'm sure. just as i thought. so what's the connection betweentatsumura and the owners? it doesn't seem to bejust protection rackets. i bet they're into somethingmore profitable than that. okay. this istheir turf, anyway. let's provoke them one by one. tojima's taking over this bar.get lost, goons! motherfucker! get him! what the hell, you guys? the tojima family's takingover this place now. if you want protectionmoney, we refuse! what?! - how did you do?- good. ah. now the takedafamily's stronghold. let's all go together. - what's that?- i got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weirdsymbols in the purchase column. let's check thenext place too. go back and tell your boss. tojima is taking overthis business for a while. it'd be interesting tofind a similar ledger. - let's check around.- yeah. somewhere like in here? this is why amateursare no good. leave these thingsto the professionals. it's just beenhigh school so far. now comes the college class. find anything? nothing of value. it's written thesame way as this. what could this mean? i'm sure it has somethingto do with their organization. six people. just six people and they'reraiding turf all over the place. and what do you want me to do? i'm truly ashamed. actually, i'm going totake care of this right now. i just wantedto let you know. in that case,leave him be. let him do histhing for a while. but that's-- don't you get it? what's a couple ofcabarets and bars? the point is to keep ourorganization unnoticed. wait and see what they uncover. sanritsu industries - hey.- huh? so what are they doing? they're not moving at all.the car's crying. we'll let it rest while it can. what the hell is going on? he's wearing a sanritsu badge! who are you calling? oh, it's you, bro! don't scare me! - i was just about to call you--- come here. what the hell is going on here? i used my brain a little. not many people know thatyou and i are brothers, right? because we havedifferent last names. so i figured it was up to me tosneak into tatsumura's place. i told you that you can't. it's too late. i'm in. so you don't wantto hear what i got? you got something? actually, i'm justabout to get it. idiot. you've got me beat. well then, brother! but be careful, you'retalking with the enemy. if you're as careless as youwere just now, you're dead. they're totally systematic. in that organization, unless you're a real old-timer,you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t figure out anything. it seems so. i tried to step on his incomestreams, but it didn't work so well. i'm sure he's got somebig source of money. i'll find it eventually. see you later, brother. all right, place your bets! but think carefullybefore betting. watch closely! here we go. that one. you choose this one? are you sure this is the one? too bad! i feel bad abouttaking from a cop. okay, one more time! we have a visitor. hey, stop. they've been going to barsand cabarets for a while. they don't seem to becollecting laundry. what are they doing? okay, i'll find out. give me a hand. hey, can i get a light? thanks. hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, what do we do? what do we do? good! it's a red light! you stupid bastard,you had me worried. i see. so the dry cleanerwas a collector. yeah. but where is thatmoney coming from? a bag this big witha bunch of bills in it. and instead of laundry,there's a load of whiskey. a daihatsu midget,whiskey, and wads of cash\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what kind of mystery is this? we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to poke around more. come on. come on. i went to see mr. ogata. i was hoping to askmr. ogata to stop you. and he told me the truth. you should have just told me. am i such an unreliable woman? no. this is my problem. i thought i'd washed my hands of thebusiness, but they don't respect that. i had to do it. to break free. i understand. but this is not just about you. good luck. you're doing a goodthing for the world. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 don't overdo it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i lie in bed, there's a man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i drink wine, there are two men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i walk down the street,there are three men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all stare at me, dead \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa boss, tojima is here. what? okay. i'll check it out. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa the people who loved me \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all disappear \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa little red flowers in the heartare hickeys made of lead bullets \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa what's up? are you stillscouting for recruits? not anymore. i found a really good warrior. i think you're inthe wrong place. is that so? i think i read the signproperly and i came in. i think the womanmade a mistake too. aren't you just a kid?don't smoke. what? i've got a lead.i'm counting on it. punch me once. you son of a bitch! what should we do? what's he up to? - let's go.- hold on. wait a little longer. - check the moonshine.- got it. i'll leave that to you. oh, hello! metropolitan police? listen, i'm at the\\\"night castle\\\" cabaret! there are drunks rampaging! yes! please come! - you're saved by the bell.- it's a draw. something extra. i wonder if it'sjust a turf war. no, it can't be. moonshine. this was the key totheir secret organization. so, through the bosses ofthe amusement quarters they would get this moonshineinto bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profitdividends to the shareholders. then this ledger is likely arecord of moonshine sales. i wonder how much moneythey can make on this. if they put import priceson such cheap liquor, they'll make twentytimes as much. - twenty times?- and it's not taxed. compared to that, protectionrackets are nothing. in any case, we're going to find out wherethe moonshine factory is. then we can havethem by the throat. first, let's do all we canto find the couriers. wait a second. what's that? they're collectingempty bottles. so they finally have ajob that looks like a job. that's kind of weird. - what?- those two cars behind us. they've been followingus for a while now. here they come! hey! that's one gone! hey! here they come again! damn it! that was close. good job. hey, matsushima, what's wrong? oh! stupid son of a bitch! why didn't you tell me sooner? this car was entrusted to me.i can't leave it with anyone. you're stubborn! what's wrong? we got shot at while tailingthe bottle collection truck! call a doctor! if it gets in the papers,they're gonna find out. it's no time fortalk like that! wait. lay him down over there. stay sitting. don't just stand there.run hot water. will it work? it didn't work outfor my brother. because it was closeto his vital organs. but it's going tobe okay this time. come on, bite down! harder! hey! he only fainted. it's done. so their focus is nowon the organization. by the looks of it, they'redoing a lot of research. maybe he's a rat for the cops. no way. no way would thecops trust a yakuza. but this needs athorough investigation. if he's willing to go so far, i have an idea too. i came here today to talk toyou on behalf of tatsumura. so now you're going to joinme and take down tatsumura? tatsumura wants to havea peaceful talk with you. i'm gonna usethis for a moment. hello. hey, it's me. yeah, i'mgiving him the phone now. it's tatsumura. hello. tojiima? it's me. i don't have anything totalk to you about now. you might not, but i do. say, would you like tohear a pretty woman's voice? what? would you liketo say something? she doesn't seem tohave anything to say. but you're not an idiot. so i'm sure you'llback off quietly. don't give in! all you've donewill be for nothing! akiko! don't worry about me! don't back off for a second! akiko! stop! got it now? back off. hello?! hello?! hell-- damn it! looks like we're done here. well, i'll leave you to it. wait, you son of a bitch! boss... sanritsu industries i'm here to see tatsumura. stay out of this, thugs. mr. tojima.he's waiting for you. excuse me, but i'llhold your things for you. what's up? heh-heh. well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - sis!- don't move! sorry about last night. i didn't mean tomake things worse. i just thought our discussion mightgo better with a woman involved. well, have a seat. we're not supposed to sitdown and talk to each other. i see. well, let's hear youranswer right away. you'll back off,of course, right? i'm not backing off yet. oh... i guess we had it all wrong. we thought you hada thing for that woman. so you don't carewhat happens to her? i'd like to ask yousomething first. do you have the guts tomake a suicide pact with me? a suicide pact? yeah. you wouldn't have the guts. because you havetoo many things. you ruined my business. and you even kidnapped akiko. thanks to you, i'm reallynaked. i have nothing to lose. not even my life. if anything happens to akiko,you can be sure i'll kill you. if you think being surrounded byguns will stop me, you're wrong. i swear i'll get it done. how about it? shall i try it right now? if you don't have the guts,return akiko immediately. then you can fight me. are you so rotten thatyou can't even do that? boss, i know who the spy is. who is it? it's that bastard kaji. he didn't see me and i caughthim trying to save the girl. i tied him up and threwhim in the basement. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 so he was the cop's dog. or was he your dog? i guess that was astupid question to ask. let's ask kaji himself. show our guest the way. so you're a dirty rat andyou had me fooled, too. i'd like to knowwho asked you to do it. i just felt sorry for the girl,so i decided to let her go. i'll make you wishthat you'd talked. - idiot!- bastard! idiot! it's useless to beat me up. useless, huh? wait. that's some nerve you got.give me the pistol. tatsumura, i have a request. you're finallystarting to understand. he was trying to save my girl.i'm responsible for that. if you're doing thisfor me, don't bother! i have no connectionwhatsoever to you. besides, he's not someoneyou can negotiate with. i see. sit him up. wait. if you're worried about me,mind your own business. i've admired men like yousince i was a kid. you've been my dream. please. please don't destroy my dream. stop! wait. wait. finally you're readyto come clean. i don't want to die bythe hand of this beast. mr. tojima. shoot me with your hand. please. give me the gun! this is one hell of a show. let me enjoy the spectacle. come on! come on! he's dead. that takes care of one of them. think the next onethrough carefully. our guests are leaving. politely see them out. tojima brothers damn. they're all over the place. everyone, just hang in there. but boss-- if we back off, osamuwon't rest in peace. akiko won't be pleased either. but with such surveillance! there's still a way! we're disbanding today! what?

guess he forgot i once refusedto give his daughter an a. do the world a favor;don't remind him of that. now, that is a secure line, so that we can, you know, talkwithout any borises listening in. just in case you have trouble stayingwarm on those long winter nights. - i was not sleeping!- you were! - i was meditating.- you were snoring in the middle of... - i was not. was i?- yes! but you find thatincredibly sexy though. - snoring!- come on, it's not an old thing! - it was a... it was a boring movie.- no. come on, i'm so with it.look, come on. look at my phone. look at all theapplications and life hacks i have here. life hacks! - whoa.- what?

- well, who posted it?- alison! alison, it's her account. god, i'm gonna kill her. and that's...that's, that's harrison, right? the president's son? yeah. sort of breaks your heartto see him before all the bad choices. - i don't see what the big deal is.- he's the president's son, ali! that makes it a big deal!plus, he really needs privacy right now. - what does that mean?- just take the picture down! are you freaking out because there issomething going on between you? i already told you, we datedfor three weeks when i was your age. we are just friends.but it is really important to me that he feels like i am someonethat he can trust. - please be more mysterious.- look, i don't want him thinking that i'm going around telling peoplethat i'm \\\"one half of starrison.\\\" and according to this,not the cute half. girls, i'm leaving. come say do svidaniya. let's go say do svidaniya. - morning, all.- morning. nadine tells mei have a very full schedule today. starting with the russian war gamesoff the alaskan coast. they began this morning. a flotilla ofsome 50 different vessels and aircraft. they're technically within their rights. the maneuvers and test firings aretaking place outside american airspace. still insultingly closeto our northern borders. we were expecting something like this.after the nato thing? yes, it's believed to be a responseto our announced deployment of the natorapid response strike force in latvia. which was our response to russia'smeddling in its neighbors' affairs. moldova being the most recent example. white house expects usto send a d\\u00e3\\u00a9marche, a diplomatic cable in protest. the nato force in latviawas the right call. i'm just annoyed that ostrov isso determined to refight the cold war, instead of fixing his crappy economy. don't put that in the protest thingy. speaking of the cold war, there's a ceremony todayfor ezra lyle helsinger, the department'soldest foreign service officer. he's retiring todayafter 60 years of service. wow. 60 years? good for him. i'm sorry. ma'am?you're needed in the situation room. elizabeth. what's up?blake couldn't give me any details. - that's because it's need to know.- ok, what do i need to know? russian war games have gotten heated. one of their subs split from the fleetand crossed into us coastal waters. not unprecedented. russians like to test our defenses,like we test theirs. but we were tracking the suband it vanished. that is unprecedented. so they've perfectedsome kind of cloaking technology. and the sub's nuclear armed. it's somewhere off the alaska shoreline,intentions unknown. could be posturing.could be about to start world war iii. - what's ostrov saying?- we tried calling. we're told he's at a remote location.he can't be reached. so he's vanished. heck of a weekfor henry to go to russia. can't disagree with you there. thank you. professor mccord,you are most welcome. - thank you, minister gorev.- you must call me anton. even after i wouldn't giveyour daughter an a? i overreached in asking.an \\\"incomplete\\\" was generous. well, good.i'm glad we cleared the air on that. as am i. indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetingsbetween our militaries. to keep the air clear. especially in a timeof such unfortunate misunderstandings. thank you very much.it's an honor to be here. i'm gonna speak with you todayabout a subject that is of great importance to our twocountries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfareor struggle. namely, jihad in classical islam and in both eastern and westernchristianity, the concept of crusade. professor mccord, may i introducethe president of the russian federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,pavel ostrov? professor mccord,it is an honor to meet you. it's also my honor, mr president,and a bit of a surprise. i like to come to this placeon occasion for a visit. for the beautiful country,the recreation and for the game. i'm told you enjoy blood sports. if, by that, you mean hunting, then, yes, my father took me sometimes. deer, duck, an occasional squirrel. then you must come hunt with me.no refusing. my pleasure is to showthe goodness of russian life to such eminent, distinguished guest. with such a beautiful, eminent wife. mr president, we've been in contact.they deny that sub is even there. still claiming their rightto refute reality. what do we know about the sub itself? we think it's the yalta, sir.it's a new sub out of vladivostok with experimental stealth technologymore advanced than ours. - apparently.- it's powered by a fission reactor, carrying six bulava-typecruise missiles, each with 150-kiloton warheadand a range of about 60 miles. but again,what is most disturbing about it... besides the fact that it could beon its way to flatten anchorage. is how they have just proven that they can evadeall forms of detection by sonar, magnetic anomalyor satellite array. a true stealth weapon. they can hit usbefore we even know they're there. ostrov's been bankrupting his economy, trying to get back to military paritywith the west. - now he may have it.- they've got the drop on us. what do they want? is ostrov just making us sweator is this more than posturing? sir, if ostrov isn't talking to us,i may know somebody who will. nadine, can you clear my schedulefor the rest of the day? - all of it, ma'am?- and, nadine, quietly, ok? - get gorev on sivits, please.- yes, ma'am. is everything ok, ma'am? yeah, it's fine.i just need to clear my schedule. it's definitely a loose nuke.we're all dead. there's a bunker in the basement. ok, that's enough doomsday.you heard the secretary. let's clear her schedule. quietly. - she's fun!- i heard that. don't try and evade the issue and don't try telling methat this sub isn't there. anton. it's just the two of us now. yes, two friendstalking openly and honestly, but friends also don't put powerfulweapons on each other's borders. hmm. i'm listening.i thought it might come to this. so, say one of our subsdid lose its direction and come too close to your alaskawith its bears and salmon. you're about to put nato troopson the latvian border, just a few hundred miles from moscow. which is less friendly? - so, what can we do about that?- cancel the nato deployment and perhaps the captainwill find his map again. come back home.honest enough for you? perfectly. you also know i'm being honest wheni tell you that bullying and threats will not alter the resolveof the united states or its allies. and your presidentneeds to pick up the phone. i will tell him myself when i see him.he can't have gone far. - what are you talking about?- didn't you know? president ostrov has invited yourhusband henry to go hunting with him. they're in the woods, hunting grouse. one of president ostrov'sfavorite pastimes. it's quite an honor for your husband. is that what it is? i'm certain they're havinga wonderful time. well, all i can say is...they better be. until later, madam secretary. sorry. hunt requires quiet, professor. we are not having very much luck today. maybe the camera crewhave something to do with it. i don't understand. with this gun,i always have very good luck. - oh, it's beautiful.- my grandfather's. he kept it with him in the greatpatriotic war, your world war ii, during the blockade leningrad. - the siege of leningrad?- you know it? yes, of course. through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cockedand loaded by the front door, so if the germans ever break through, if they come to the housefor my aunts and my grandmother, he has somethingto shoot the enemy with. and if necessary...his family and then himself. may i ask, sir,why you're telling me all this? our peopleare never frightened, professor, and we outlast our enemy. so, tell your wife and your president,we don't back down. i will convey your message,mr president. but to be honest, i have no ideawhat you're talking about. don't worry. they will. he did what? yeah.my left ear is still ringing. now i know what that was all about.he was using me for propaganda. let's just hope that's all you are. - you think he'd take me hostage?- i don't know. clearly, he coordinatedthe sub incursion with your visit. it's just optics. lecturingthe secretary of state's husband while his sub is sneaking around alaska? the message is,don't let nato troops go into latvia. well, now that we've heard it,why don't you come home? no, if i cut and run now,he'll just know that we're scared. i should act like everything is fine. they've invited me to touran orthodox monastery of st george. i think i should go. besides,it's a significant historical site, crucial to the spread of christianityduring mongol rule. i am finding your dorkinessoddly reassuring right now. we need you in there. henry, i gotta go. - be safe, ok?- i will. ok. henry alright? as long as the only actual shotsbeing fired are at a bunch of defenseless birds,yeah, i think we're alright. this is ostrov grandstanding.clearly, the man likes to put on a show. what do you propose? if he wants to grandstand,hide and seek with the sub, and whatever he's trying to dowith the secretary's husband, we should put on a show right back. not only mobilizethe strike force to latvia, but deploy the sixth fleet's flagshipto the black sea. turkey will allow it,but it's posturing. it's us doing exactly what ostrovis doing, only bigger and louder. surest sign of strengthis to show you are able to use it. but are we willing to use it, sir? i think we just got a signalthrough your husband, bess. all this russian presidenttruly understands or respects is force. - give the order to move the fleet.- yes, sir. we've cleared the secretary's schedule,but one item's proving tricky. - and that is?- ezra helsinger's retirement ceremony. she's expected to give a speechor at least make an appearance. - today's his last day.- he's a living legend. everyone's gonna be there,including press. m-sec doesn't show, there'll be rumors. i'll let her know. keep it on for now. speaking of rumors, i'm hearingthe pentagon's parking lot is hopping. people coming in insteadof going home? never a good sign. yup, we're all about to be fraggedby a fiery ball of death. it was nice to know you. daisy, something you should see. you know the secretary'sso protective of the family? \\\"let them say what they will about me, so long as they leavethe kids out of it?\\\" the kids are not out of it. well, the secretary'snot gonna love this, but it just looks likeyour typical internet rumors. daisy, you have a phone call. - it's the secretary's daughter.- or not. she's at the mouth of glacier bay, resting on a seabedin 100 meters of water. within the 12-mile limit. a violationof our territorial sovereignty. aerial recon detected a burstof very low-frequency transmission. they're fairly certainthey were attempting to communicatewith their command vessel. since then, nothing. no distress signal, no response toour radio transmissions or hydrophone. ostrov still isn't picking up his phone.what's his game, bess? trying to back us out of latviai thought. but to be honest, at this moment, sir,i don't know. is there an optic cableburied along that coast? land-linked to our anti-missiletracking stations up north. so, it could be a spy missiontrying to tap that cable. yes, and it hassix nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying juno55 miles down that channel! it could be awaiting orders! if they wanted to nuke us,they have icbms that could obliterate new yorkin 20 minutes. why park a sub off of alaska? juno would be gone in 30 seconds. and then the sub would disappeardown the coast to seattle, la. how longbefore we can physically engage? you mean threaten it, sir?capture it and report it? i mean destroy it. sir, our closest surface vesselis the navy minesweeper kirkland. it can be at the site within 90 minutes. tell the russians they have two hours. two hours for that sub to be goneor we take it out ourselves, by whatever means necessary. which the russianswill view as an act of war. and this isn't? can't say we didn't warn them. sorry i'm late. so, we're gonna pay tribute tomr helsinger just like nothing's wrong. yes, ma'am. is anything wrong? uh, nothing we're talking about. ma'am, your speechdoesn't need to be formal. just a few unrehearsed,off-the-cuff remarks. and here they are. great. six decades of service in germany,eastern europe and the middle east, a crewman for a vanderbilt yacht and a writer for timeand the paris review. ezra, you truly are a witness to and a creator ofwhat your first boss, henry luce, called \\\"the american century.\\\" thank you. enjoy your life. and have some cake! yeah, sure, sure. oh, please, don't get up, ezra. i'm very sorry.i was supposed to bring you your gift. but we're a little disorganized today. there's no need to apologize, ma'am.the threat of war with the russians? that's apt to frazzle a person. and on the very daythat the last of the cold warriors shuffles off to buffalo too.how's that for irony? has someone been telling you things? i have seen this movie before,madam secretary. the russian navy holding war gamesin the bering sea. i... i happened to see a little itemon the dod daily rundown this morning. we are sending a naval flagshipinto the black sea. ostrov is posturing on russian tv. and with your husband, no less. he's a handsome fella, by the way. you've cleared your calendar. except for those eventswhere your absence would be noticed. you really do knowhow to read the signs. now, tell that to the dmv.they took my damn license! you still work for me, for the nextseveral hours anyway, right? um... yeah. till five o'clock. so, there's this invisible submarine,a super weapon, it's just sitting there,letting us look at it. right! i was wondering about that too. i mean, why turn offthe stealth technology? well, back in my day, we only tried to readthe russians' intentions. their mentality. to look at the chess playeras well as the pieces on the board. well, that's sort of tough since ostrovwon't even admit there's a game. not even talking. but see,that in itself tells us something. i mean, he's a bully and a poser, right? well, the question iswhy isn't he bragging? throwing this in our face? right... right. why... why not tell the russian public or the whole world, for that matter, that he snuck advanced technology inright under our noses? beat us at our own game. in our backyard. and you're right. you know,it isn't like ostrov to hold back. unless there's somethinghe didn't count on. - something went wrong.- hm-hmm. that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. and again... ostrovwould never admit that, would he? makes you wish it was him sitting herenow instead of me, doesn't it, so you could ask him? you do knowthere's no smoking in here? hm-hmm. oh, yeah, yeah. an ordinance against smokingin this building since 1997, i think. i miss the war. i, too, have great respectfor st nicholas. stop filming.what are you doing here, henry? your tour of the church is over. i mean, st george is great.the warrior saint. the victor. but st nick represents compassion. he's the one you turn towhen times are tough. of course,we've trivialized him in the west, made him into the precursorof our modern-day santa claus. what is your point? thought that maybewe would light a candle together. i don't think so. i'm in no need of miracles.you may be. not me. so, we clear? no more pictures.nothing personal. - no posting where others can see.- and? absolutely nothing involvingthe first family or the white house. - thank you.- ok, then, leave it to me. i'll see what i can do to keep majornews outlets from picking up the story. - without telling mom?- yeah, no. it'll all be fine.besides, the best defense is the truth. and since you and harrisonaren't actually an item... you'd tell me if you were, right?honestly, he is kind of cute. - i mean, i'd understand.- no, i have a boyfriend, ok? - oh, yeah? who's that?- it's just this guy that i work with. another internfrom the microloan program? - uh...- wait, what's with the face? are you, like, dating your bossor something? oh, my god.wait, are you dating arthur gilroy? - yeah. look, i know it sounds...- stevie, no. forget harrison.now we have a problem. mom and dad are fine with it. sort of. they may be fine as parents,but from a press perspective, looking at damage control? there are three wordsthat can never go together in this town, and that is \\\"boss,\\\" \\\"intern\\\" and \\\"sex.\\\" - you've gotta end it. now.- what? why? what do you think will happen whenit comes out about you two? and it will. i will deal with it. the microloan programwas on the chopping block. people would loveto get back at your mother. they'd happily throw arthur gilroyonto the fire to do that. you really thinkthat's what will happen? i know it will. this is st nicholas we're talking about?as in kris kringle? he means something morein orthodox tradition. he's the one you turn toin cases of calamity, when things have turned against you. just an observation,but he seemed like a different person. like he was afraid, even. - afraid of what?- i don't know. but i know when true believersare really praying, and ostrov was. the guy that took me huntingthis afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way. could something have happenedto change that? as a matter of fact, something did. henry, i gotta take thisto the president. if ostrov is scared, it may bebecause he's lost control of that sub. you think he could overreact? that or we will. - at this point, it's academic.- wait. the deadline isn't up yet! i'm overriding it.we've got the russians' response. two battle cruisersand three sister attack subs are on a direct course to glacier bay. carrier strike group is on its way to intercept. the sub hasn't budged. the kirkland's stationed over it, aboutto commence dropping depth charges. why? standard naval etiquette. you don't surrender,we force you to surface. the kirkland.we are directly above the target. we are about to drop depth charges. three, two, one. standing by.something's happening. fish in the water.target has launched a torpedo. initiating countermeasures. we are hit.repeat, the kirkland has been hit. sir, we've lost communicationwith the kirkland. carrier strike group has re-establishedcontact with the kirkland. - damage assessment?- injuries. so far, no fatalities. a visual from a medi-chopper.ship is under power, headed for port. norad reports a squadron of russianmig-35s just performed a flyover. - saw the kirkland take the hit.- damn it! i've got northcom and thecommander of the us pacific fleet requesting immediate authorityto engage. a communiqu\\u00e3\\u00a9 from the russians.their vessel was defending itself. any further attack will be met withquote \\\"overwhelming retaliatory force.\\\" without getting into specifics. call their bluff, sir.they're guilty of an act of war. all due respect,we don't know who's guilty of what. i'm just saying, mr president,before we declare war, let's determine exactlywho we're going to war with. what if that sub hasn't movedbecause it's incapable of moving? what if something went wrong? that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. the captain and crewcould be operating without orders, off the chain of command of the kremlinand his president. what does it matter?we respond to actions, not intentions. we do not let an attackon american lives go unanswered. and we don't go to war over a mistake! outside. ostrov lost control of the yaltabecause your husband knows religion and he saw ostrov ask santa for a wish? the secretary's husband has shownhe can be a pretty effective operative, as well as a religious scholar. well, what if i trust your analysis? say ostrov is scared, operatingin the blind, like we all are here. - then what?- we don't push him to the brink. not until we know more. every second we waitlets those battleships get closer or lets the sub fire another missileor six of them, all of them nukes. if we hit it with one of ours,it's got a 10k reactor on board. we risk sending a radioactive tsunamidown the channel... that'll make fukushima a fond memory.i get it, bess. so, what do you propose? we have to take one last chanceand try and talk to that submarine. directly and without moscow knowing. there has to be a way. that's the unmanned submersible.if the russian crew gets a visual, they'll know it's harmless,incapable of attack. we're tapping on their hull. we're using the retractable armto tap out a message. - morse code.- old school, but it works. we're asking them to statetheir name, mission, allow us on board. that's them answering. there's activity. one of her torpedo tubesis opening, flooding. she's gonna fire. no. it's her distress buoy. they're asking for help. stephanie! are you and harrison dalton dating?is he a good kisser? stephanie, is it true?are you and harrison dalton dating? hey, you ok? yeah, i'm not used to being ambushed. yeah, you've had a lot of pings. you're gettingsome serious unwanted attention. yeah, they were outside my house.and then on the street. it's crazy. don't worry. you and harrison are justfilling bandwidth between kardashians. it's gonna blow over soon.none of this matters. listen to me, what matters is our work. right? the microloans program,that's what matters. yeah, about that... hey, you're not quitting, are you? oh, you're quitting this. us. both. i'm quitting... i'm quitting both. look, once they figure outthat i'm not dating harrison, they're going to figure outwho i am dating. so what? you really wanna throw awayyour whole career on some intern? i know i've harped on this a lot,but i have been around, ok? just let me... let me worry about that. look, ok, you know what?you're too old. you're too old and it's not gonna work. is that what you need to hear? uh, ok. ok. it's been really nice working with you. listen to me, do you really wanna losewhat means so much to you? please, just take a few daysand think about the job, not me. the job. ok. i have to go. see you around, kid. see you around, old man. he's the executive officerof the russian submarine, the yalta. they're transmitting from the bridge. they have an antennaattached to their distress buoy. they suffered a malfunctionwhen the new technology failed. there was a fire in the control room.they couldn't contain it. a loss of oxygen. 42 crew members have already died. that's two-thirds of their crew. the captain broke radio silenceto report it. we received instructions. do not signal for help. do not allow the americans to board. if you can't restore power,then destroy the sub and all evidenceof new deflector technology. anything to keep usfrom getting our hands on it. ask why they fired the torpedo. the captain panicked. he thought they were being attacked. the captain's no longer in commandof the vessel. nice way of saying they mutinied. we only have two hours of oxygen left.we're asking for your help. please help us. please... help us. the russian battle cruiserhas reached our line of quarantine. we tell the russians we're gettingthose men out, they'll refuse. they're close enoughto send out a missile and destroy it themselvesbefore we touch it. so, no good options. ostrov will never admit failure or concedethat one of his crews mutinied. not in public. there may be a way to resolve this. a deal that even he can live with. butwe need to go through back channels. and we happen to have one. we do. it's an interesting offer. president dalton will confirm it's real.you can call him directly. i'm sure it's genuine,but i wonder if there are alternatives. the alternative is a returnto the days of the cold war, sir. there was a time whenour two countries, our two grandfathers, fought on the same side. mine survived a siege too. bastogne. the battle of the bulge. at the end of the war, he exchanged cigaretteswith russian soldiers on the elbe river. traveling here, i thought of him.he would've been happy. he knew first-handwhat our countries could accomplish when they work togetherfor the common good. i wear this in honor of mine. - st nicholas.- my grandfather's name saint. nikolai is an old family name. he, too, may have been happyto see us here in peace. perhaps this iswhat he sacrificed so much for. i will call your president. the fire occurred on the yaltaafter an accidental nighttime collision between the russiannuclear-powered submarine and the us minesweeper kirkland. the disabled sub then driftedinto american territorial waters where us naval personnel boarded itin an attempted rescue. tragically, they found no survivors. - crew members will be buried at sea.- poor guys. what a way to go. i'm just glad that thingsdidn't escalate with russia. - look who i brought.- mr helsinger. - we thought you'd left.- your tour of duty ended yesterday. well, i figured one more daywouldn't matter. also, they told mei still had to pick up my gift. oh, yes, the secretarywanted to give that to you personally. it'll just be a few more minutes. i'll wait. getting used to that, waiting. oh, yeah. interestinghow all that turned out, isn't it? - very sad story.- uh-huh. but defense is handling it.we had nothing to do with it. still, it is very interesting. and it is a story. kind of makes you wonderwhat really happened. hmm. these are all of them? all 20 survivors of the yalta.a few hours ago. being given a top-secretand strictly classified welcome aboard the uss teddy roosevelt. the russians will be announcing thattheir remains have been buried at sea. so we'll leave it to themto make sure the story holds up. as you said,they are good at refuting reality. - ostrov accepted the deal?- yes, sir. they'll all get new lives andidentities, here in the united states. the price for letting us rescue them.unbelievable. in all fairness, sir, we did geta chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealthtechnology before giving it back. at least those poor bastardswon't get sent home and shot for mutiny. but they will never seetheir families again. not even to let them knowthat they're alive. any contactputs their loved ones in danger. all so that ostrovcould save face. hell of a thing. sir, the nato forcesare still deploying to latvia and the yalta situationdidn't spiral out of control. - we won this round.- yeah. the world did not blow up on our watch. for at least another day or two. probably my first day on the job. i could not believei was meeting the old man. - whoa. is that john foster dulles?- yeah. the architect of permanent peacein europe. stood up to soviet aggression. that picture was taken the day presidenteisenhower and secretary dulles signed the treatybringing germany into nato. he always said that,\\\"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the...\\\" \\\"the necessary art.\\\" would you guys give us a minute? - congratulations, sir.- thank you. - a pleasure.- mine. i never even asked youwhere you were going. oh, um... prague. budapest, berlin. you ever thinkyou'd live to see the day when the wall came down,open borders, free elections? sometimes we wondered if we'd liveto see the next five minutes. but somehow we understoodthat if we just kept talking... in the end, the sovietsdidn't want to push that button any more than we did. there was a... a rationality to it,crazy as it seems. mutually assured destruction. yeah, but your new enemies today,they have no such qualms. they wanna push that buttonand there's no holding them back. that's a bit grim, isn't it? i don't know. makes me feel naive for being hopeful. oh, you'll be fine. i've seen a lot of them come and go. i think you're the one for the job. - ezra.- madam secretary. you and i should keep talking. well, for what it's worth,ali feels terrible about \\\"starrison.\\\" i know she does. it's ok. and i'm sorry about \\\"starthur.\\\" let's not go crazy with the names. i think that you did a very adult thing. but i know it was hardand i'm so sorry that you're hurting. - come here.- thanks. - sweetie.- well, at least dad will be overjoyed. but he'll hide it well,which is all you can ask for. hm-hmm. this is nice, by the way. you going to an event tonight? i am. the mccord family dinner.soon as dad gets back. oh. yeah, i don't... i don't knowif i'm up for that. well, get up for it. we're celebrating. - why?- because we can. because we're here. dad's home! come on! get your coats. we founda place with awesome vegan options. - i did.- that's nice. listen, i just want you to knowthat even when it's hard and no matterhow much it hurts right now, it is not the end of the world, ok? where are they? here they are. i missed you guys. what do you think? - oh, i think it's awful.- hi. hi. oh, mom texted me. i'm so sorry, honey. - nice try, dad.- i mean it, honey. - hey...- come on. let's get some food, please. - let's go, guys.- wait. let me just get my coat. - dad, can i wear the hat?- no. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from  \",\n          \"\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bf \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:   previously on reign: lord castleroy. i know i'm notthe man of your dreams. will you accept my humble proposal?

but i have done this for you. i love you, and i've put you first. you can't just leave melocked in here. francis! francis! no! gabriel commandedmy best archer corps. some of his men were twice his age. but they all loved him. he sang to them at night. he sang of this place.his home. your brother died fightingfor his home, his people. with great bravery. i understand you lost a son today. but i lost a soldier, and onlyone of those can be remedied. gabriel's men followed himbecause he was a nobleman. they will follow his brotherfor the same good reason. please. we don't need your money.martin's only 14. he's too young. a year older than i waswhen i first saw combat. my lord duke, i can't allow it. you can. and you will. would you ask my mento sacrifice themselves for the protection of estatesthat won't sacrifice for them? be proud of your sons. i am. forward! no. no... watch out! don't hit lola! i'm fine.i'm not that far along yet. it wasn't so long ago we were alltalking about our first kisses? - now you're all married.- and soon you will be as well. unless i ruin it before then. or my father does. he's arriving today,and i'm worried he'll offend lord castleroywith too small a dowry. we can't afford much. have you told lord castleroyyour family's lost its fortune? he might be understanding. tell a suitor we're broke?my father would have a heart attack. i've had more opportunitiesthan you can count. and what do i do? fall in love with a servantand nearly ruin his life, too. we've all had the same opportunity,and look at us. i never dreamt that i'd be wed toa bastard with an imaginary title. lola's been forced to hide herpregnancy. even mary and francis... yes, when we couldn't cometo terms on my brother, my beloved husbandlocked me in a tower. it's been almost a month. are you and francison any better terms? well, i can now talkto him without screaming. does that count as \\\"better\\\"? your majesty?i have dire news from scotland. it's about your mother,marie de guise. the protestants and theirlords of the congregation have sent an army to besiegemy mother in edinburgh. there are men outside thecastle demanding her surrender. her friends don't know how muchlonger she can hold out for. mary, i'm so sorry. my brother james warnedus that the protestants were planning a rebellionagainst my mother. if i had gone with him,i could have stopped it. or you could've been killed. this news only proves it. it's too badwe couldn't protect my mother by locking her in thetower as you did with me. instead of arguing,let's help her. your mother needs soldiersand quickly. and how are we supposed to get them?certainly not from your father. armies can be bought. who has that kind of money? my mother. francis, i've already askedyour mother. more than once. - she's always said no.- then we will ask her together. and we will keep askinguntil she says yes. mother, we need to talk. i realize that.why do you think i sent for you two? oh, you sent for us?so you've heard the news then? i'm sorry, mary.you must be crushed. well, i'm worried, i'm not crushed. there's still timeto send reinforcements. oh, dear. i don't think we'retalking about the same news. have you not heardabout the succession? whose succession? not yours, i'm afraid. word came from england.it's official. elizabeth will be their next queen. - mary tudor's dead?- no! the old bitch is stillclinging to her miserable life. but she managed to cough up the gallto hand over her crown to elizabeth. a bastard, a protestant no less,and not my son's wife! are you even pregnant yet? could you possibly beany less use to france? do not talk to my wife that way.she's a queen and an ally. she was supposed to get me england! we've been feedingand housing this ally for most of her pointless life.and what have we gotten? a drain on our treasure and army, an endless paradeof dramas and headaches. scotland protects france by engagingthe english on two fronts so it cannot focus its forceon growing its foothold on your backyard, calais. i don't need a lecturefrom you on geography. scotland cannot bluntthe english threat alone, your grace. - especially not now!- yes, i've heard all about it. protestants threatening your mother.she needs reinforcements - just like always.- no, not just like always. she is under siege.there are soldiers at her gates! and now you're afraidyour poor mother might die? well, don't we owe itto scotland and france, as rulers, to ask if thatmight be a good thing? your mother can't handlethe job that you gave her. or else she wouldn't be under siege! father, stop this. mary's crown is at stake,which puts france at risk as well. more than her crown is at stake. your mother failed us completely. and now they wanther head on a pike. be careful. or yours might follow. no one? not one country or lord offers help? my mother is a catholic ally. she is under attack. enemies screaming for her head,and no one cares? scotland has many friends at court. but every conversation i have with anoble or diplomat ends the same way. \\\"we're with you, dauphin,but what does the king say?\\\" i hope you didn't tell them. mary, i should neverhave let my father... words don't bother me. you are safe in this castle. - not even my mother...- threats don't bother me, either. losing bothers me. - mary, that's silly, you're...- a queen? yes, i am. but one with scant power here. and less every day back home. on the other hand, i'm also queenbecause i'm a de guise. i have very powerful uncles. i hope you're not thinking... my mother is surroundedon all sides. protestants are burningand pillaging catholic churches. why would they stop theircampaign of destruction before making sure i losemy mother and my crown? but the duke of guise? ever since you've been back at court, you've chosento keep your distance from him. the same as my parents have. your uncle is a dangerouslyambitious man, who has built himself an army bystealing recruits from their mothers. and paying them well. do you know anyone elsewith an army as large or as loyal? loyal to him. and him only. is that someone that you can trust? he is my uncle. if that doesn't buy mehis loyalty, well... trust is a luxuryi can no longer afford. sorry, you're not to be letin under any circumstances. do you know who i am? you're the contest winnerthe king enjoyed. and then cast aside. penelope, what are you doing here? surely a bounty of demeaning tasksawaits you in the kitchen. - i need to see the king immediately.- hmm. i'm pregnant. with his child. you're not pregnant. even if you are,it's not with the king's child. well, the king will want to know. he's going to wonder if he's gotanother chance at happiness. another chance at a childhe could truly love! shut her up now. henry, i love you and i miss you!and i'm carrying your child! you're pregnant? you're certain it's my child? there's been no one else,your majesty. - i was a maiden when you took me.- oh, that's nonsense. see that she's taken care of. set her up with a cottagein one of the villages. oh! i have some mistresses. in bernay, i think. the child could havesiblings to play with, huh? wait. that's all i get? henry! it's more than you deserve. are you sure you wantto be playing this game? if you overplay it, if he losespatience with your displays, you won't like how it ends. the two dead girls before you didn't. nothing bothers me more than problemsi've already solved coming back to be problems again. if that's what you makeof yourself, my child, expect me to make youa lesson to my other problems by grinding you into the dustyou no longer see fit to sweep. oh-oh-oh!oh, i've missed you two so much! father. where's mother? she's at homewith your other sisters. i've only brought these twoso you could introduce them to potential suitors. aren't they a little youngto be looking for husbands? considering all thetrouble we've had with you, i regret not bringing them sooner. and i hope you haven't made toolarge a mess for me to clean up. i realize i made a mistake, but it'snot as bad as you may have heard. no? tell me, will there be any surprises for lord castleroyon your wedding night? anything he can accuse you of later? no, it didn't go that far. does that embarrass you? then imagine howit embarrassed the family. i may sound harsh,but it's for your own good. you can't affordto lose another suitor. do i have it wrong? no, father. i stopped by our new houseon the way back. it needs workbefore we can live there. especially if we want tobring it to your standards. bash, that's lovely,but what happened out there? you've been outin those woods for weeks hunting that creature.have you found it yet? the darkness? no sign of it yet,but it's only a matter of time. the blood wood is vast,but not limitless. have you been all right? i hope there haven't beenany more encounters with the king. i've been staying out of his way. waiting for you to return. why do you stop? it's not our first kiss.you're my husband, it's all right. it's not as though i'm inexperienced. i'm well aware of that. well, if you wanted a virgin... no, i don't.but i care about your experience. i know not all of it has been good. there's no changing that now. i disagree. what are you doing? helping you forget everythingand everyone that's come before this. tell me what you want... very specifically.leave nothing out. all right. do you have any ideawhat you've done? francis, you should havetalked her out of this madness. you should have helped her. i know you're a student of history. perhaps you missed this chapter: the duke was dismissedfrom your father's court for grasping at too much power. and you know what he did then? he fielded that armyto grasp at more. he's a vicious self-serving killer,a threat to any throne. coming from you,that's a ringing endorsement. i wouldn't be so smug, my dear. you just let the devil into our home. thank you so much for coming, uncle. we wish it was underbetter circumstances. like your wedding, perhaps? i seem to have missed my invitationto that happy event, your grace. the wedding was very rushed.i hope you took no offense. nonsense. don't troubleyourself over niceties. i don't. dauphin. the king and queensend their regards. they regretnot greeting you personally, but urgent mattersdemand their attention. you don't have to make excuses. i'm aware of your parents'opinion of me. and from what i hear,even when your father is present, the king is no longer in the castle. i don't know what rumorsyou've heard, sir, but... call me christian,and let's spare ourselves lots of pointless formalityand posturing. i have friends who tell mewhat goes on in this castle. i know why you asked for me, and i'm here toget you out of the hole my sister's incompetence put you in. very well, no posturing. my mother is in danger,but i'm guessing that it will take more thanfamily loyalty to buy your help. so what will it be? money? land? neither. your father dismissedme from court years ago. i want a position in court again. a more permanent one. lord magistrate of france will do. the lord magistrateis the king's right hand. you want a better position thanthe one that you were stripped of after you challenged your king? i didn't challenge my king,i served him. by appointing generalswithout his permission and doling out political patronageto your friends? while your father was busy producingheirs, bastards and otherwise, he needed my help,whether he cared to admit it or not. he needed your loyalty, whetheryou cared to provide it or not. i can make your army serveme for nothing if i wanted. i have that authority. they're right outsideif you'd like to try. i just don't know how many will stillbe around tomorrow if i'm not. they're loyalto the man who pays them, not the boy who waves crowns at them. we'll consider the termsand present them to henry. uncle. your father will never agree. he has to. or you'll lose scotland,and so will we. hurry up!i mean, i want you and everything, but we must be quick. what's the meaning of this? sorry, your majesty, i was just... i know what you were just,you vile little man. have you no decency? laying your handson a favorite of your king? leave, before i have youthrown in the dungeon! i hope he didn't hurt you. - no.- i got here just in time, didn't i? if that man had had his way, he'd be able to claimyour unborn child, and where would thatleave you with the king? i'm already pregnant.my child is the king's. then i'm sure you'll agreeit's not just yourself that you need to protect anymore. the life of the king'sunborn baby is at stake. we simply can't risk that. you need to go somewhere safe. the king will be outragedwhen he finds out you're locking meand his baby in here. no, the king will be outragedwhen \\\"his\\\" baby comes out looking more likeone of his stable boys. or, more likely,no baby comes out at all. neither of those things will happen. enjoy your solitude, my dear. i'll drop by every month or so to share in the joy ofwatching your belly grow. wait! don't leave me here! a word of advicefrom someone who knows: don't make friends with the rats.they bite. wait, wait. greer tells me her sisters havenever been to a castle before. i say we give them the royal tour. that can wait. i'd like to discuss the matterof greer's dowry as soon as possible. now? in front of your daughters? we don't need to discussgreer's dowry. i've given the matter some thought,and i'm not interested. not interested? then what is it you want? only your blessing for her hand. you have it, my lord. i can't tell you how happythat makes me. i need to speakwith you, father. it's urgent. - nothing is more urgent than war.- i agree. that's why i came to discussa solution for scotland. all this time we've been waitingfor mary tudor to give us england. to allow us the privilegeof putting your wife on the throne. but the english don't wait. they take what they want,just like they took calais from us. so i'm going to take it back. after that,i'll take all of england. we'll attack from scotlandin the north and calais in the south. when they wake up tomorrowto see french soldiers massing around calais,we might even get lucky. they might surrender to sparethemselves certain defeat. tomorrow? how could you...? i can't wait to see thelook on mary tudor's face when i claimthe english throne for myself. i just hope that sick cow liveslong enough for me to execute her. father, tomorrow? - what have you done?- can't you read? general brantome's men are movingnortheast from rouen as we speak. general brantome? i had to relieve laval.no imagination. no courage. stop babbling, father,and tell me the truth. - did you do this?- why wouldn't i? we don't have the strengthto take calais. our armies are spread too thin,all over europe! if we lose,and they capture our forces, they can stage an invasion andsweep down through france unopposed! but francis, we can't lose! yes, we can, and we will! father, thousands will die. you don't understand. \\\"blessed be the lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.\\\" i prayed for his guidance, and he spoke to mein a glorious waking dream. he said that i wouldclaim victory at calais! son, be happy with me! thanks to your father,you are going to rule half of europe! francis? what's the matter?you look like you've seen a ghost. i have.it's father, he's gone utterly mad. define \\\"utterly,\\\"because this is a man who's ridden a pigthrough the throne room in nothing but his under things. mother, he is starting a war. - what?- he's attacking calais. oh, francis. your father,is that what he told you? - it's all over his maps.- darling, relax. i've taken general lavalinto my confidence. he knows to do nothingwithout my approval. general laval has been dismissed. brantome's in charge now. who's brantome? oh, yes, i forgot. he's the new one henry brought in to replace laval when herefused to rename the fifth army \\\"god's gauls.\\\" don't worry, brantome's with us. all of these dismissed generals. i'm beginning to guesshow mary's uncle knows so much. what will you do when father realizesyour contravening all his orders? tomorrow he'll beinvading the spanish. the next day the dutch. when he starts rememberingwho he invaded yesterday, perhaps his wits will have returned, and this whole nightmarewill be over. darling, relax. if i left things to chance, we'd still be bowingto queen penelope. i promise, it's under control. for france's sake,i hope you're right. no. not yet. you know, we can stop all this. it worked.i've forgotten all about... you see, i can't even rememberwhat his name is anymore. good. there's still morethat i want you to forget. oh, in that case, i'll forget thatyou told me not to take off my skirt. that's not what i mean. i want you to forget... every boy who ever smiled at you. every man who ever flirted with you. everyone but me. were the guards necessary? surely a messengerwould have sufficed. i wanted to speak to you alone,away from your men. but not away from your men, i see. have you spoken with your father? the king will not agreeto the position you want. you never asked him, did you? we both know it was a fool's errand. there is something elsethat you want from me. are you going to tell me,or am i meant to guess? wise men look to the future. they're patient. when i started to buildmy army a decade ago, other men saw a ragtag rabble. i saw what it would become: a bargaining chipthat would one day bring kings to me, begging for favors. you never expected to befather's lord magistrate. you want to be mine, when i'm king,even if you have to be patient. i won't have to be patient for long,i don't think. is it poison, i wonder,that is driving him mad? i don't trust youand i don't like you. well, being liked is a king's job,not his lieutenant's. everything in me saysi should say no. and yet you are here...away from your wife. i think you knewyou might have to say yes, and she would object. she would pay any priceto save scotland, but would never ask you to. she knows how your familyfeels about me. well, you've just explainedto me why i love her. enough to have her lockedin a tower, i've heard. do you want this positionor don't you? i want the chanceto serve a great ruler. great rulers aren't afraid ofthe truth, no matter how painful. the truth is, you love your wife. the truth is, she needs me. so what will it be... my prince? when i am king,the position is yours. but i have one condition. your men will report to meas they would to you. - but why would you need my men to...- i'm going with you to scotland. well, that's unwise. and if you die,your promise to me is worth nothing. well, then,i suggest you keep me alive. are you serious? my uncle agreed? he'll send enough men to scotlandto quell the rebellion and save my mother? yes. i'd almost lost all hope. francis, how did you manage it? i convinced the dukethat it was in his best interests. - i'll explain when i'm back.- back? back from where? i am going with him to scotland. what? francis, no. mary, i have to. it's the only way that i canassure your mother's safety. and what of your safety? well, the duke getsnothing if i don't survive. with a man like that,i can't imagine a better guarantee. francis, i don't know what to say. you're saving my country,my mother, and you're risking your lifein the bargain. you needn't say anything. i've only kept my promise. as a king and a husband. you've done so much more than that. i'm not complaining, but... i thought you wantedto take things slowly. not anymore. i'm here now. out with it. there was never a baby. that took less time than i thought. please can i keep workinghere in the castle? i'll empty chamber pots,i'll muck stalls, anything. oh, stop groveling. as much as it warms me to hear it. i may have other uses for you. - other uses?- i have ladies, technically, they're my friends,none of whom i trust. because they're womenwho sleep with men for a cause. much like you did with the king. only it would be my cause. i promise you'll enjoy it morethan emptying chamber pots. i'm gonna send you toa lady i know in italy. you'll be taught proper manners,and the art of deception. and if you work hard, you may bewelcomed back in the castle as a member of my flying squad. this is where you thank me. thank you, your majesty. uh... that will need fixing, too. my family has owned successfulmines for generations, and i'd always hoped topass that expertise on to my son, but unfortunately,i've had only daughters. take the dumfries mine, it's returned 20 tonsof copper a week for years. a perfect investmentfor a man such as yourself. lord castleroy does quite wellin the spice industry, father. why would he want to invest in minesall the way over in scotland? you can't want me towaste lord castleroy's time explaining things that arebeyond your intelligence. do i have it wrong? i think you do, sir.quite wrong. i think you forget you're no longersimply addressing your daughter, but my future wife. and i'm sorry to say that'snot your first mistake. i've done research on your mines,and dumfries... has been played out for years. much like the rest of your holdings. now, let's look atsome different figures. as part of our marriage settlement,i will provide 10,000 francs to each of greer's sistersto be used as their future dowries. this will allow your daughtersto marry men of title and fortune, making you and your family wealthy. that is what you want, isn't it? uh... there is just one condition. greer will have final approvalover her sisters' marriages, so she can see to it thatthey marry men they love, not those forced on them. why are you doing this? a good businessman always knowswhat something is worth. and to me, greer is priceless. i never meant for youto go to war for me. when are you goingto realize that i love you, and i'll do anything for you? darling, let me be gratefulfor what you've done without making promisesyou can't keep. what you did was extraordinary. i think maybe when i return, you won't be the only onewaiting for me. you're suddenlyvery sure of yourself. i am. but just to be safe. look at me. am i the only one in this bedwith something to forget? what do you mean? when you're with me, i want to be the only oneinside your head. i want you to look into my eyesand see only me. i want you to alwaysremember what i feel like. so when you're using yourfingers for some other task, you wish they weretouching me instead. i will. i want you to always remember whatit feels like to be with your wife. ah, my wife and my son. closest family i have in this world. sharing my castle,my blood, my legacy. why would you lie to me? what do you mean? don't bother addingmore lies to the pile. i know what you've done.you've kept me caged up in this place like one of your song birds. sending in generals to humor me. don't blame mother when you've been hatching plans to attackhalf of europe. they aren't plans anymore! french forces marchedfor calais this morning. they're already halfway there. you think i'm delusional? read these dispatches. they aren't from anyof your performing generals. what happened to general brantome? i've sacked them all.we don't need any generals. not when we have a kingto lead our men. i leave tonight to join the invasion. oh, dear. no trousers. this keeps happening. i realize now that you twowere only trying to protect me. guarding my legacy. but that's my job, not yours. i will not be rememberedas king henry, ruler who dreamed of conquest. i'll be remembered asking henry, conqueror. greatest military strategistsince hannibal. henry, darling, you're not well. i have headaches!you know what else i have? the backing of god. francis, please,talk some sense into your father. it's too late.we can't stop the invasion. and anyway, father's right. what? we can take calais. any fool knows he can't do that. it's true, father's armywould fail on its own. but two armies. one marching head on. the other across this frozen marsh, flanking the english from behind. do you mean the duke's army?mary's army? mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that? my son, making history with me, just like i've always dreamed. i wanted to apologizefor my behavior earlier. i hope i wasn't out of line. it's my father who should beapologizing, though he never would. no one's ever stood up for me likethat before. or for my sisters. i was surprised to see how quietyou acted around your father. i've come to ratherenjoy your usual nature. outspoken, bold. how long have you knownthe truth about us? i've known for some time. as a businessman,i always do my research. but as a gentleman,i wasn't about to bring it up. and as your future husband,you should know i'm... too rich to care. i can't thank you enough. no need to thank me. everyone deserves a chanceto find happiness. just as i have. which brings me to this, i havesomething i'd like you to look over. but promise me you won't sign ituntil you're ready. this is our wedding contract. yes, and since you're now in charge of all marriagecontracts for your family, it means nothingwithout your approval. is something wrong? no, that felt surprisingly right. so you are takingmy mother's last hope, leaving her to the mercy ofthousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown. mary, please understand. i do understand. you're doing what you thinkis best for your country. not only my country. if france is beaten at calais,your country will suffer, too. - france can hardly defend scotland.- defend scotland? when have you ever defended scotland? except with brave words? - that is not fair.- now you want fair? we are rulers, not schoolchildren. blood will be spilled becauseof the choice you have made, - my mother's blood.- you don't know that. but the blood of thousandswould be spilled... - yes, french blood, i know.- i do not only think of france! no, you do not. but you do put her first. as any king would. then can you forgive me? it is myself i cannot forgive. i've made an awful mistake. our marriage was an awful mistake. please don't say that. there were a thousand momentswhere i could've done something. made secret treaties, sold favors, even snuck away to scotlandto be with those people who need me. and do you know why i didn't? because i love you. because i am your wife. mary, listen,when we have taken calais, the first thing i will dois travel to scotland with your uncle's army. we can still save your mother. like when you promised you wouldtake me to scotland with my brother? like when you promised soldiersthe time before that and the time before that? you make it sound like every promisei make is an empty one. what other promise can you make? you are the future king. it's not that simple. maybe it should be. for both of us. what does that mean? nothing. i don't know. i'm only going to asktwo things of you. the first is that youstop making me promises you know in your heartyou can't keep. and the other? come back to me. live through this battle. and don't let england cost me you. forward! have faith, mary.francis is clever and strong. he'll return home safely. i hope so. but even if he survives, our marriage is... what? francis is tryingto save his country, and i can forgive him for that, as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needsto be done for scotland, whatever that may be. what if he can't forgive you? well, that will just be too bad. i won't let him putmy country at risk again. watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

- what are you investigating?- is tatsumura involved? there are rumors that sanritsuindustries is behind all this. isn't its president tatsumurathe mastermind behind this incident? aren't you flooded with complaints aboutpolice ineffectiveness in the case? they say the authorities are toocautious, or worse, weak-kneed. i'll ask you the same question:what do you guys think? it's easy to criticize others. but are you trying to bring backthe old, heavy-handed police power? it's not as if cautiousinvestigation is bad. and that's part of thedifficulty of this job. it's not you who's been getting yourmen killed at every turn, it's me. oh, hi. the press? yeah. i got a little excited. i went to the farewell ceremonyfor detective sugiyama. i see. well. that's three in a row. - what a shame.- yeah. and...the meeting? it's like we've hit a dead end. we don't have a concrete plan. all the violent incidentsin this neighborhood are connected tosanritsu industries. i'm sure i'm onthe right track, but i don't know where to startto catch them by the tail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 we don't have a single clue. we're helpless. it's our own faultthat the city is calling us weak-kneed. the three men who diedwould turn in their graves. sanritsu industriesbusiness information chairman saichi sakurapresident j\\u00e5\\u00aago tatsumura i just had an idea. i heard a rumor on the street. tatsumura has recently takencomplete control of the organization. they say things are gettingawkward with his uncle, sakura. mmm-hmm... so? if we can crack the organization bysuccessfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get someclues for the investigation. i see. but that would require-- of course.we can't do it alone. we really need the help of a manknowledgeable about the organization. mmm-hmm. a kind of guerrilla operation. interesting idea, but i don't know if there's anybodywho could be that useful. i actually have a littlebit of an idea about that. oh? who is it? tojima brothers hello! hello! coming! oh! old man! hi. hi. welcome. - are you two working together?- no. she wouldn't stop askingme to show her how to fix it. boy, you look terrible! oh! did you have the ceremony yet? no, not yet. it seems rather sillyto call it a wedding now, but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - we'll invite you when we do, mr. ogata.- sure. - please come in.- okay. it looks like two more cars have beenadded after not coming here for a while. but the two drivers are unavailable,so they're just like decorations now. - please have a seat.- okay. hard-working, kind-hearted\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 she'll make a good wife. yeah... i suppose so. so, what broughtyou here today? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 it's kind of hard to saywhat i'm asking you to do. actually, i just wanted to askyou to go back to the old you. - the old me?- yes. a yakuza. old man, don't jokearound with me. i wouldn't joke aboutasking you to do this. please... i really need your help! what's the story? you want me to be a g-man. you're no strangerto tatsumura. i would like to ask you to do this. and let me assure you, this isn't about saving theface of the police or anything. we have to crush that germ-likeorganization as soon as possible. old man, if you want to talk about that,please take it up with someone else. i'm asking because i knowi can count on you. it's not a job thatjust anybody can do. don't give me too much credit. i'm not that respectable. but-- first of all, i don't want to doanything that'll open old wounds. okay. maybe i shouldn't haveasked you to do it. why don't you get outof this business? i'd be happy tohelp you find a job. it would be my pleasure. but i'm a man with no education at all living only for this jobsince i was a simple police officer. the grime sticks anddoesn't seem to come off. i might have to die to get it clean. i'm sorry i can't help you. it's okay. i'll definitelyattend your wedding. yeah. bye. oh? is mr. ogatagoing home already? - yes.- oh. what was that about? it has nothing to do with us. yes, this is tojimatransport co. huh? what's up? it's the usual\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - hello.- how's it going? are you ready toaccept our protection? i refuse. i don't wantto be under your care. think carefully about it. without a driver there wouldn'tbe any business, you know. what? what did he say this time? don't worry about it. huh? the car's back. oof! brother! - osamu!- osamu! what's wrong? he said he gotjumped by thugs. - thugs?- yeah. - let's go inside to treat the wound.- yes. so when did you get out? today. i was on my way here. i was surprised to see that thetruck was marked \\\"tojima transport\\\"! boss, i'm quitting. no matter how many livesi have, it won't be enough. what are you saying? the two guys taking a break musthave gone through the same thing i did. you can't tell usto fight the yakuza. let's do it, bro!i can help you! to be honest, i'm disappointedthat you quit the business. osamu... what have you learnedfrom four years in juvie? i'm not going to fight. i'm going now because they'reprobably waiting for me. you're free to quit. you can take yoursalary up to today. bro! bro! i'm disappointed in you, bro. where's the brotherthat i used to know? i'm sure he wouldn't just sit backand let this happen to him! idiot! damn it! you're not my brother! osamu! don't talk to yourbrother like that. - take care of yourself.- thank you. but, you know, don't youthink it's frustrating? when you'reprovoked like that-- it's frustrating, but we'll be out ofbusiness if we take on every fight. we're not selling fights. but you were the boss's daughter.you should understand how i feel. i've forgotten, you know, the old days. both your brother and i. suit yourself. no wonder my brotherbecame a coward. his wife's too beautifuland too decent. sassy little thing,aren't you? you should look beforeyou say something weird. tojima brothers you see? this business belongsto you and your brother. damn it. my brother, he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 your brother was really lookingforward to you getting out. you have to understand. we're half-brothers. we're not meant to be likeother brothers in the world. what are you talking about? i'll throw you a welcomehome party tonight. what's your favorite thing? what do you want to eat? osamu? osamu!where are you going? who was it? who was it? who did this? - mr. jo.- boss! - this is my car.- what? i parked it on the cornerover there, and it's\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 that's right. why is this happening again? shall i take care of this? mind your own business.leave me alone. don't say that. you need our protection in casethings like this happen. right? - that means you guys are--- boss! anyway, let's go in. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6they've even come toyour business for protection money? if they know the old you, they wouldn'tbe able to do something stupid like that. well, go ahead. sorry. because of my mess,even your store is-- no, actually, my businessis being blackmailed, too. you too, jo? yeah. in the beginningthey called me to invite me. when i refused, the thugs came. i told 'em to look people in the eyewhen talking and threw 'em out. and here we are today. you didn't report itto the police, did you? yeah, i thought about that. but if the cops are there allday long, no customers will come. they predictedthat much, all right. do you know which groupthe thugs belonged to? they belong to the takedafamily down the street. i think sanritsu industries is themastermind behind the protection racket. i heard that thetakeda family's boss became a shareholder ofsanritsu industries the other day. i think that's fishy. i didn't know that. a champion, huh? well, i'm past my prime ifi'm remembering the old days. welcome back! oh... - what happened to your car?- uh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what happened to the drivers? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 did they all quit? yes. but that's okay.hire someone new again. maybe i should learn to drive. what about tomorrow's work? i turned it down earlier. i'm sure it's not a good time. come on! tonight is osamu'swelcome home party. it's going to beat my apartment. - osamu?- what's wrong? i showed those guys from the takedafamily how strong i got in juvie. idiot! what would you do ifsomething happened to you? worry more about yourselfthan you do about me! - osamu, what happened?- ouch! captain fujikawa washappy that you agreed. we'll help as much as we can. but this work is informal. yes. so it's strange when i'm theone asking you to do this, but - you take good care of yourself and--- old man. you needn't worry about that. i'm willing to do it evenif no one asks me to do it. well, i feel better nowthat you put it that way. and what about your subordinates? i want to work in my own way, so i'm going to get five or sixguys who are used to fighting. what i'd really like from youis a car that starts fast. i've already got it for you. i've got a good driver too. - come with me now.- okay. why did we stop here? well, wait and see.he'll appear any moment. huh? matsushima! hey, you're caught red-handed. i haven't done it yet. you should be glad you haven't. if you had, you'd be backeating stinky food in jail. sorry. i'll tell you what, instead, i'mgoing to have a little chat with you. please, no more lectures-- that's not what i meant. - i want to show you something.- huh? whoa! this engine--it's like a sports car! what do you think?would you like to drive it? oh? you don't mind? - i'll leave it with you.- yeah! oh, it's a police motorcycle. - should we make a run for it?- idiot! you should stopfor the poor guy. are you sure? do you know how fastyou were going just now? thank you for your work,but there's a reason for that. are you on a case? yes, well, something like that. sorry about that.thank you for your work. this is great!shall we try a little more? i've had enough of this.i'll turn it down this time. i'll introduce you toa guy you might like. go! you damned fool! what the hell are you doing?fuck you, motherfucker! come here! get the fuck off me! you son of a bitch!you ruined a girl's life! get the fuck off me!get off of me! - what's going on?- oh... he tricked a runawaygirl and sold her. oh. well, that's the guy. he's so hot-blooded that hesometimes forgets his duties. but he's a great shot.i'll introduce you. - excuse me.- oh! what are you doing? - i see, he's fast--- drop the gun! oh, excuse me. mr. ogata asked meto test your skills. sorry, sorry.this man is right. never trust a personwho has a gun. by the time you get madat their trick, it's too late. okay. old man,you should explain. - i have some other ideas.- okay. ron. there you go. ron. - here, reach!- ron! little three dragons. half flash. you bastard! you son of a bitch! bro! i don't know what all this is about,but give him a break. i'm telling you-- let's go. come on. man! thanks for saving me. i guessit's different when you're a pro. don't you have any shame,cheating a bunch of thugs?

they're all gone. how did that happen? well... a series of disturbancesthe other night, you know, bartenders running away,waitresses being taken\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 even the debt was takenover by sanritsu industries. the former championis no longer in shape! i'll give them all to thatbastard tatsumura! i'll explain later, but i wantyou to come to my place tonight. hey, sis! my brother's back! honey, those people havecome to pick up the truck. did you really sell it? yeah, we've alreadymade the deal. please take it! hey, why are you doing this?what are we going to do now? i'm sorry to break it to you, but i've decided togo back to my old life. what? you'll have to live in theapartment for a while. that's the brother i know! sorry, but there's a world of men thatwomen don't understand. right, bro? you go live with her.and get a job. that's stupid! please, please don't do it. did you forget whathappened four years ago? didn't you almost die tryingto crawl out of the muck? don't get desperate just becausethings aren't working here. we can go somewherewhere there are no yakuza. please, please don't do it. i'm sorry, but i'vemade up my mind. this time i'm goingto do it my way. that's right!that's right, brother! but you can't do it alone, bro.hey, please, let me do it. i'll bring my friendsif you want. idiot! i said no, you can't do it. pack your bags with her. i've now given youthe gist of it. i'd really like somehelp from you all. i just want to assure you thatwe're subcontracting for the police. it's low-pay despite the risk. i'd like to know if you'restill willing to take it on. please don'thesitate to tell me. when you say subcontracting forthe police, how will you start? first i'll pretend to makea comeback to the yakuza. then i'll infiltrate their organizationunder the guise of a turf war. that would meanwe're the tojima family. gentlemen, this is theperfect role for you. if you look in the mirrori think you'll see what i mean. i don't want to flatter you, buti'd hardly call you all good citizens. but it takes a hell of a lot ofguts and horsepower to hit them. you're all perfect teammembers in that regard. hey, bro, even though it's police work,we're putting our lives on the line. there will be a littlereward, won't there? i can't guarantee that. i'm sure you'llmanage it just fine. but don't forget there'sa policeman next to you. so let's hear your answer. can you guys give me a hand? let's show them what we can do! i'll get tatsumura backfor his protection racket. how about you, matsushima? well, i'm being askedto take care of the car. i don't see anyoneelse qualified. goro? i'll do my best tosave the extra money. mr. policeman? it's my duty soi'll do whatever-- you scared me! - osamu!- brother... don't treat me like a stranger! everyone, i'm hisbrother, osamu kaji. we're actually half-siblings. how many timeshave i told you? i'm not gonnamake you one of us. again with that.i wish you'd trust me. but a goofball like youwould be the first to get hit. i can't take careof a guy like that. well, then, brother.you mean you can't-- you'd be slowing me down.give it up. fine, then!i'll do my own thing! osamu... osamu! he's just like you the way he won'tback out of something once he's said it. he's a real pain in the ass. so everything isokay then, right? okay, now let's get to work. first you'll go out and spread wordthat i'm making a comeback. tojima brothers \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by pistol. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by tommy gun. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by dynamite. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa everybody, everybodydisappears in a puff of smoke \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa with water. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when the blood lefton the bed dries up \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa there, i hear it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that rhythm \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa sing it! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa dance all you want! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa jam session on anenchanting night \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa i'm drunk and i'm all alone \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa may i sit here? if you don't mindme sitting with you. would you like tobuy me a drink? in return, you tell mewhose territory this is. you sure aren'ttight-lipped, are you? i'll have what he's having. i hear a retired yakuza namedtojima is making a comeback. well. i'm sure there willbe an uproar now. i don't thinktatsumura will allow it. but tojima and tatsumuramust have been like brothers. people only think that's true. they don't get alongwith each other very well. i'm telling you thisfor your own good. if you want to make a living as ayakuza, it's smarter to join tatsumura. thanks for the advice. if you want, i can askthe higher-ups for you. did tatsumura ask youto scout for the yakuza? huh? you'll have to ask tatsumura if you can hirea guy named tojima. then you're\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 next time you see me,call me tojima. recreation center construction who are you? you almost got yourself killed. do you know what'sgoing on here? i do, but thanks anyway. don't get me wrong. i'm here to kill you.don't move! do you recognize this face? five years ago\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 five years ago? in a turf war on the beach,you shot a guy named kuroki. then you're kuroki's-- i'm his younger brother. now that you remember,i'm going to kill you. wait! that wasn't supposedto be a fatal injury. no respectable doctorwould've treated that wound. it's no wonder it was fatal. i made a vow then. i swore i'd kill youif i ever saw you! are you hurt? you think you saved me? that doesn't make upfor my brother! wait a minute! i get how you feel, buti've got a job i've got to do. i won't let you stop me. - boss, are you hurt?- i'm fine. the advertisement worked 100%. i've already gota lot of sponsors. that's the guy. him? a debt is a debt. i'll wait untilyour job is done. in exchange, i'm not leavingyour side for a while. i won't let you dieuntil it's by my hand. so you're a bodyguard. well, okay. he's an old friend of mine.try to get along. starting tomorrowwe're going to be busy. sanritsu industries boss, tojima is here. what do you want to do? i thought they'dbe here by now. hey. to what do we owethis surprise? it's been a while. how's your shippingcompany doing? i heard you were happy togetherwith the previous boss's daughter. i don't think i can makea living as an honest man. i'm going backto the old tojima. i see. that's why you came allthe way out here to say hello. shimadzu. let's celebratetojima's comeback. book a welcome home party-- you already threw mea welcome home party. a fancy one with lead bullets. i know it was supposedto be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. tojima.... you've become nastierliving as an honest man. i'm not as bad as you. you took over this buildingin less than four years? i was hoping you'd tell mehow to make money. that's the kind of advice one canonly get from a professional. i wish you'd stopwith the innuendos. sanritsu industriesis a legitimate company. and we pay our taxes. if you want, you cango ask the tax office. but i hear there's a lot of money to bemade without the tax office knowing. what do you mean? for example...protection rackets. that sort of workfits these guys. don't move! what's this? a raccoon dog's tail? i'm the one who built all this. i have some allies,but also many enemies. you can never be too careful. everyone, leave us. i think it's time tocut to the chase. i'm being extorted, it seems. no, i just need a little help. it's a lot of work to make upfor four years of absence. i'd like to borrow your territoryfor a while, for old time's sake. sorry, i don't have anythinglike that right now. i have enough to eat running atheater and a recreation center. oh yeah? that's a relief. then i'll make my ownterritory without reservation. that's all well and good,but be careful. they say once a boxer retires,he never makes a comeback again. jinxes can be brokensomeday, you know. well, look forward to it. i see. tojima has shown up so now tatsumura hasmore things to worry about. that's why he tried toget rid of him last night. that was a screw-up,out of character for tatsumura. i'm getting lucky. it's good to live a long time. you've pit the two against eachother for your own advantage? i'm the one who originally createdsanritsu industries, after all. i didn't want to keep it intatsumura's care forever. so... shall we propose the election of a newpresident at the next general meeting? no, i think we'll waitand see what tojima does. - chairman!- hmm? mr. tojima has cometo say hello to you. good thing he came now. have him come over here. mr. chairman,it's been a while. yeah, a while. i hear youmade a comeback the other day. yeah. i'll needyour help again. yeah, sure. but now i'mpractically retired. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 i heard a rumor that you'll be returningas president of sanritsu once again. there are too manyirresponsible rumors out there. i agree. i was even gossipingwith tatsumura just now. with tatsumura? they sayyou had a dispute last night. that's just anotherirresponsible rumor. but you better be careful. it's weird saying thisto your face, i've always preferred youto tatsumura. if you ever need help,i'm always here for you. oh. i'll see you, then. well, i'll leave youalone for today. this is a fine housefor an old fox's nest. and they're even planningto expand the place. sanritsu industries i see. that old manand tojima, huh? i think we can still dosomething about it now. you're something yourself too. what are you after? the sakura family's territory? well, if that's on the table. okay. i'll grant you that. in exchange, get to work. eliminate the old man. boss. he's your blood relative. i don't remember havingan uncle like that. murakami. take the kijima brothers. mr. chairman. these men say that theycame from tatsumura. what do they want? can't you handle it yourself? no, i definitely can't. what are you doing?stop it, you! chairman of sanritsuindustries murdered killing anyone whogets in the way? but this is too much! this is exactly howtatsumura works. now their organizationis strengthened again. we have to find anew way to get inside. welcome. can iget you a drink? i don't have any money.here, let me pay with this. we're supposed to ask for cash. don't be so uptight. i heard whoserestaurant this is. welcome. eh? are you the onei need to talk to? maybe. we'll see. boy, where are you from? check the family register.no comment. well?! i want a clear answer! come this way. here. the pistol. wait here. manager's office i have someonewe could use. we heard your story. - go home for today.- what? we have to check if the gunhas been used in a crime. if you can't tell by holding it,then you're an amateur. what? that gun isn't loaded. you're not qualifiedto be a bouncer. move! are you the boss? if you really want to workhere, do as you're told. waving that thing aroundwon't get you anywhere. got it? got it. nice to meet you. the takeda family controlsthe bar area here. the bars and cabarets in this areaare the yoshi family's territory. both are backed bysanritsu industries, i'm sure. just as i thought. so what's the connection betweentatsumura and the owners? it doesn't seem to bejust protection rackets. i bet they're into somethingmore profitable than that. okay. this istheir turf, anyway. let's provoke them one by one. tojima's taking over this bar.get lost, goons! motherfucker! get him! what the hell, you guys? the tojima family's takingover this place now. if you want protectionmoney, we refuse! what?! - how did you do?- good. ah. now the takedafamily's stronghold. let's all go together. - what's that?- i got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weirdsymbols in the purchase column. let's check thenext place too. go back and tell your boss. tojima is taking overthis business for a while. it'd be interesting tofind a similar ledger. - let's check around.- yeah. somewhere like in here? this is why amateursare no good. leave these thingsto the professionals. it's just beenhigh school so far. now comes the college class. find anything? nothing of value. it's written thesame way as this. what could this mean? i'm sure it has somethingto do with their organization. six people. just six people and they'reraiding turf all over the place. and what do you want me to do? i'm truly ashamed. actually, i'm going totake care of this right now. i just wantedto let you know. in that case,leave him be. let him do histhing for a while. but that's-- don't you get it? what's a couple ofcabarets and bars? the point is to keep ourorganization unnoticed. wait and see what they uncover. sanritsu industries - hey.- huh? so what are they doing? they're not moving at all.the car's crying. we'll let it rest while it can. what the hell is going on? he's wearing a sanritsu badge! who are you calling? oh, it's you, bro! don't scare me! - i was just about to call you--- come here. what the hell is going on here? i used my brain a little. not many people know thatyou and i are brothers, right? because we havedifferent last names. so i figured it was up to me tosneak into tatsumura's place. i told you that you can't. it's too late. i'm in. so you don't wantto hear what i got? you got something? actually, i'm justabout to get it. idiot. you've got me beat. well then, brother! but be careful, you'retalking with the enemy. if you're as careless as youwere just now, you're dead. they're totally systematic. in that organization, unless you're a real old-timer,you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t figure out anything. it seems so. i tried to step on his incomestreams, but it didn't work so well. i'm sure he's got somebig source of money. i'll find it eventually. see you later, brother. all right, place your bets! but think carefullybefore betting. watch closely! here we go. that one. you choose this one? are you sure this is the one? too bad! i feel bad abouttaking from a cop. okay, one more time! we have a visitor. hey, stop. they've been going to barsand cabarets for a while. they don't seem to becollecting laundry. what are they doing? okay, i'll find out. give me a hand. hey, can i get a light? thanks. hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, what do we do? what do we do? good! it's a red light! you stupid bastard,you had me worried. i see. so the dry cleanerwas a collector. yeah. but where is thatmoney coming from? a bag this big witha bunch of bills in it. and instead of laundry,there's a load of whiskey. a daihatsu midget,whiskey, and wads of cash\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what kind of mystery is this? we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to poke around more. come on. come on. i went to see mr. ogata. i was hoping to askmr. ogata to stop you. and he told me the truth. you should have just told me. am i such an unreliable woman? no. this is my problem. i thought i'd washed my hands of thebusiness, but they don't respect that. i had to do it. to break free. i understand. but this is not just about you. good luck. you're doing a goodthing for the world. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 don't overdo it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i lie in bed, there's a man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i drink wine, there are two men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i walk down the street,there are three men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all stare at me, dead \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa boss, tojima is here. what? okay. i'll check it out. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa the people who loved me \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all disappear \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa little red flowers in the heartare hickeys made of lead bullets \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa what's up? are you stillscouting for recruits? not anymore. i found a really good warrior. i think you're inthe wrong place. is that so? i think i read the signproperly and i came in. i think the womanmade a mistake too. aren't you just a kid?don't smoke. what? i've got a lead.i'm counting on it. punch me once. you son of a bitch! what should we do? what's he up to? - let's go.- hold on. wait a little longer. - check the moonshine.- got it. i'll leave that to you. oh, hello! metropolitan police? listen, i'm at the\\\"night castle\\\" cabaret! there are drunks rampaging! yes! please come! - you're saved by the bell.- it's a draw. something extra. i wonder if it'sjust a turf war. no, it can't be. moonshine. this was the key totheir secret organization. so, through the bosses ofthe amusement quarters they would get this moonshineinto bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profitdividends to the shareholders. then this ledger is likely arecord of moonshine sales. i wonder how much moneythey can make on this. if they put import priceson such cheap liquor, they'll make twentytimes as much. - twenty times?- and it's not taxed. compared to that, protectionrackets are nothing. in any case, we're going to find out wherethe moonshine factory is. then we can havethem by the throat. first, let's do all we canto find the couriers. wait a second. what's that? they're collectingempty bottles. so they finally have ajob that looks like a job. that's kind of weird. - what?- those two cars behind us. they've been followingus for a while now. here they come! hey! that's one gone! hey! here they come again! damn it! that was close. good job. hey, matsushima, what's wrong? oh! stupid son of a bitch! why didn't you tell me sooner? this car was entrusted to me.i can't leave it with anyone. you're stubborn! what's wrong? we got shot at while tailingthe bottle collection truck! call a doctor! if it gets in the papers,they're gonna find out. it's no time fortalk like that! wait. lay him down over there. stay sitting. don't just stand there.run hot water. will it work? it didn't work outfor my brother. because it was closeto his vital organs. but it's going tobe okay this time. come on, bite down! harder! hey! he only fainted. it's done. so their focus is nowon the organization. by the looks of it, they'redoing a lot of research. maybe he's a rat for the cops. no way. no way would thecops trust a yakuza. but this needs athorough investigation. if he's willing to go so far, i have an idea too. i came here today to talk toyou on behalf of tatsumura. so now you're going to joinme and take down tatsumura? tatsumura wants to havea peaceful talk with you. i'm gonna usethis for a moment. hello. hey, it's me. yeah, i'mgiving him the phone now. it's tatsumura. hello. tojiima? it's me. i don't have anything totalk to you about now. you might not, but i do. say, would you like tohear a pretty woman's voice? what? would you liketo say something? she doesn't seem tohave anything to say. but you're not an idiot. so i'm sure you'llback off quietly. don't give in! all you've donewill be for nothing! akiko! don't worry about me! don't back off for a second! akiko! stop! got it now?

heh-heh. well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - sis!- don't move! sorry about last night. i didn't mean tomake things worse. i just thought our discussion mightgo better with a woman involved. well, have a seat. we're not supposed to sitdown and talk to each other. i see. well, let's hear youranswer right away. you'll back off,of course, right? i'm not backing off yet. oh... i guess we had it all wrong. we thought you hada thing for that woman. so you don't carewhat happens to her? i'd like to ask yousomething first. do you have the guts tomake a suicide pact with me? a suicide pact? yeah. you wouldn't have the guts. because you havetoo many things. you ruined my business. and you even kidnapped akiko. thanks to you, i'm reallynaked. i have nothing to lose. not even my life. if anything happens to akiko,you can be sure i'll kill you. if you think being surrounded byguns will stop me, you're wrong. i swear i'll get it done. how about it? shall i try it right now? if you don't have the guts,return akiko immediately. then you can fight me. are you so rotten thatyou can't even do that? boss, i know who the spy is. who is it? it's that bastard kaji. he didn't see me and i caughthim trying to save the girl. i tied him up and threwhim in the basement. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 so he was the cop's dog. or was he your dog? i guess that was astupid question to ask. let's ask kaji himself. show our guest the way. so you're a dirty rat andyou had me fooled, too. i'd like to knowwho asked you to do it. i just felt sorry for the girl,so i decided to let her go. i'll make you wishthat you'd talked. - idiot!- bastard! idiot! it's useless to beat me up. useless, huh?

why? better calling plan or...?- it's a more secure line. there's nothing covert about this visit. i'm just lecturing about fundamentalismto a bunch of colonels. first of all, it's not just a lecture. these military-to-military exchangeshelp keep the peace. it's a big deal. i feel special again. thanks. you think anyone gets invitedto these things, especially at the behestof foreign minister gorev? guess he forgot i once refusedto give his daughter an a. do the world a favor;don't remind him of that. now, that is a secure line, so that we can, you know, talkwithout any borises listening in. just in case you have trouble stayingwarm on those long winter nights. - i was not sleeping!- you were! - i was meditating.- you were snoring in the middle of... - i was not. was i?- yes! but you find thatincredibly sexy though. - snoring!- come on, it's not an old thing! - it was a... it was a boring movie.- no. come on, i'm so with it.look, come on. look at my phone. look at all theapplications and life hacks i have here. life hacks! - whoa.- what?

- well, who posted it?- alison! alison, it's her account. god, i'm gonna kill her. and that's...that's, that's harrison, right? the president's son? yeah. sort of breaks your heartto see him before all the bad choices. - i don't see what the big deal is.- he's the president's son, ali! that makes it a big deal!plus, he really needs privacy right now. - what does that mean?- just take the picture down! are you freaking out because there issomething going on between you? i already told you, we datedfor three weeks when i was your age. we are just friends.but it is really important to me that he feels like i am someonethat he can trust. - please be more mysterious.- look, i don't want him thinking that i'm going around telling peoplethat i'm \\\"one half of starrison.\\\" and according to this,not the cute half. girls, i'm leaving. come say do svidaniya. let's go say do svidaniya. - morning, all.- morning. nadine tells mei have a very full schedule today. starting with the russian war gamesoff the alaskan coast. they began this morning. a flotilla ofsome 50 different vessels and aircraft. they're technically within their rights. the maneuvers and test firings aretaking place outside american airspace. still insultingly closeto our northern borders. we were expecting something like this.after the nato thing? yes, it's believed to be a responseto our announced deployment of the natorapid response strike force in latvia. which was our response to russia'smeddling in its neighbors' affairs. moldova being the most recent example. white house expects usto send a d\\u00e3\\u00a9marche, a diplomatic cable in protest. the nato force in latviawas the right call. i'm just annoyed that ostrov isso determined to refight the cold war, instead of fixing his crappy economy. don't put that in the protest thingy. speaking of the cold war, there's a ceremony todayfor ezra lyle helsinger, the department'soldest foreign service officer. he's retiring todayafter 60 years of service. wow. 60 years? good for him. i'm sorry. ma'am?you're needed in the situation room. elizabeth. what's up?blake couldn't give me any details. - that's because it's need to know.- ok, what do i need to know? russian war games have gotten heated. one of their subs split from the fleetand crossed into us coastal waters. not unprecedented. russians like to test our defenses,like we test theirs. but we were tracking the suband it vanished. that is unprecedented. so they've perfectedsome kind of cloaking technology. and the sub's nuclear armed. it's somewhere off the alaska shoreline,intentions unknown. could be posturing.could be about to start world war iii. - what's ostrov saying?- we tried calling. we're told he's at a remote location.he can't be reached. so he's vanished. heck of a weekfor henry to go to russia. can't disagree with you there. thank you. professor mccord,you are most welcome. - thank you, minister gorev.- you must call me anton. even after i wouldn't giveyour daughter an a? i overreached in asking.an \\\"incomplete\\\" was generous. well, good.i'm glad we cleared the air on that. as am i. indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetingsbetween our militaries. to keep the air clear. especially in a timeof such unfortunate misunderstandings. thank you very much.it's an honor to be here. i'm gonna speak with you todayabout a subject that is of great importance to our twocountries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfareor struggle. namely, jihad in classical islam and in both eastern and westernchristianity, the concept of crusade. professor mccord, may i introducethe president of the russian federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,pavel ostrov? professor mccord,it is an honor to meet you. it's also my honor, mr president,and a bit of a surprise. i like to come to this placeon occasion for a visit. for the beautiful country,the recreation and for the game. i'm told you enjoy blood sports. if, by that, you mean hunting, then, yes, my father took me sometimes. deer, duck, an occasional squirrel. then you must come hunt with me.no refusing. my pleasure is to showthe goodness of russian life to such eminent, distinguished guest. with such a beautiful, eminent wife. mr president, we've been in contact.they deny that sub is even there. still claiming their rightto refute reality. what do we know about the sub itself? we think it's the yalta, sir.it's a new sub out of vladivostok with experimental stealth technologymore advanced than ours. - apparently.- it's powered by a fission reactor, carrying six bulava-typecruise missiles, each with 150-kiloton warheadand a range of about 60 miles. but again,what is most disturbing about it... besides the fact that it could beon its way to flatten anchorage. is how they have just proven that they can evadeall forms of detection by sonar, magnetic anomalyor satellite array. a true stealth weapon. they can hit usbefore we even know they're there. ostrov's been bankrupting his economy, trying to get back to military paritywith the west. - now he may have it.- they've got the drop on us. what do they want? is ostrov just making us sweator is this more than posturing? sir, if ostrov isn't talking to us,i may know somebody who will. nadine, can you clear my schedulefor the rest of the day? - all of it, ma'am?- and, nadine, quietly, ok? - get gorev on sivits, please.- yes, ma'am. is everything ok, ma'am? yeah, it's fine.i just need to clear my schedule. it's definitely a loose nuke.we're all dead. there's a bunker in the basement. ok, that's enough doomsday.you heard the secretary. let's clear her schedule. quietly. - she's fun!- i heard that. don't try and evade the issue and don't try telling methat this sub isn't there. anton. it's just the two of us now. yes, two friendstalking openly and honestly, but friends also don't put powerfulweapons on each other's borders. hmm. i'm listening.i thought it might come to this. so, say one of our subsdid lose its direction and come too close to your alaskawith its bears and salmon. you're about to put nato troopson the latvian border, just a few hundred miles from moscow. which is less friendly? - so, what can we do about that?- cancel the nato deployment and perhaps the captainwill find his map again. come back home.honest enough for you? perfectly. you also know i'm being honest wheni tell you that bullying and threats will not alter the resolveof the united states or its allies. and your presidentneeds to pick up the phone. i will tell him myself when i see him.he can't have gone far. - what are you talking about?- didn't you know? president ostrov has invited yourhusband henry to go hunting with him. they're in the woods, hunting grouse. one of president ostrov'sfavorite pastimes. it's quite an honor for your husband. is that what it is? i'm certain they're havinga wonderful time. well, all i can say is...they better be. until later, madam secretary. sorry. hunt requires quiet, professor. we are not having very much luck today. maybe the camera crewhave something to do with it. i don't understand. with this gun,i always have very good luck. - oh, it's beautiful.- my grandfather's. he kept it with him in the greatpatriotic war, your world war ii, during the blockade leningrad. - the siege of leningrad?- you know it? yes, of course. through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cockedand loaded by the front door, so if the germans ever break through, if they come to the housefor my aunts and my grandmother, he has somethingto shoot the enemy with. and if necessary...his family and then himself. may i ask, sir,why you're telling me all this? our peopleare never frightened, professor, and we outlast our enemy. so, tell your wife and your president,we don't back down. i will convey your message,mr president. but to be honest, i have no ideawhat you're talking about. don't worry. they will. he did what? yeah.my left ear is still ringing. now i know what that was all about.he was using me for propaganda. let's just hope that's all you are. - you think he'd take me hostage?- i don't know. clearly, he coordinatedthe sub incursion with your visit. it's just optics. lecturingthe secretary of state's husband while his sub is sneaking around alaska? the message is,don't let nato troops go into latvia. well, now that we've heard it,why don't you come home? no, if i cut and run now,he'll just know that we're scared. i should act like everything is fine. they've invited me to touran orthodox monastery of st george. i think i should go. besides,it's a significant historical site, crucial to the spread of christianityduring mongol rule. i am finding your dorkinessoddly reassuring right now. we need you in there. henry, i gotta go. - be safe, ok?- i will. ok. henry alright? as long as the only actual shotsbeing fired are at a bunch of defenseless birds,yeah, i think we're alright. this is ostrov grandstanding.clearly, the man likes to put on a show. what do you propose? if he wants to grandstand,hide and seek with the sub, and whatever he's trying to dowith the secretary's husband, we should put on a show right back. not only mobilizethe strike force to latvia, but deploy the sixth fleet's flagshipto the black sea. turkey will allow it,but it's posturing. it's us doing exactly what ostrovis doing, only bigger and louder. surest sign of strengthis to show you are able to use it. but are we willing to use it, sir? i think we just got a signalthrough your husband, bess. all this russian presidenttruly understands or respects is force. - give the order to move the fleet.- yes, sir. we've cleared the secretary's schedule,but one item's proving tricky. - and that is?- ezra helsinger's retirement ceremony. she's expected to give a speechor at least make an appearance. - today's his last day.- he's a living legend. everyone's gonna be there,including press. m-sec doesn't show, there'll be rumors. i'll let her know. keep it on for now. speaking of rumors, i'm hearingthe pentagon's parking lot is hopping. people coming in insteadof going home? never a good sign. yup, we're all about to be fraggedby a fiery ball of death. it was nice to know you. daisy, something you should see. you know the secretary'sso protective of the family? \\\"let them say what they will about me, so long as they leavethe kids out of it?\\\" the kids are not out of it. well, the secretary'snot gonna love this, but it just looks likeyour typical internet rumors. daisy, you have a phone call. - it's the secretary's daughter.- or not. she's at the mouth of glacier bay, resting on a seabedin 100 meters of water. within the 12-mile limit. a violationof our territorial sovereignty. aerial recon detected a burstof very low-frequency transmission. they're fairly certainthey were attempting to communicatewith their command vessel. since then, nothing. no distress signal, no response toour radio transmissions or hydrophone. ostrov still isn't picking up his phone.what's his game, bess? trying to back us out of latviai thought. but to be honest, at this moment, sir,i don't know. is there an optic cableburied along that coast? land-linked to our anti-missiletracking stations up north. so, it could be a spy missiontrying to tap that cable. yes, and it hassix nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying juno55 miles down that channel! it could be awaiting orders! if they wanted to nuke us,they have icbms that could obliterate new yorkin 20 minutes. why park a sub off of alaska? juno would be gone in 30 seconds. and then the sub would disappeardown the coast to seattle, la. how longbefore we can physically engage? you mean threaten it, sir?capture it and report it? i mean destroy it. sir, our closest surface vesselis the navy minesweeper kirkland. it can be at the site within 90 minutes. tell the russians they have two hours. two hours for that sub to be goneor we take it out ourselves, by whatever means necessary. which the russianswill view as an act of war. and this isn't? can't say we didn't warn them. sorry i'm late. so, we're gonna pay tribute tomr helsinger just like nothing's wrong. yes, ma'am. is anything wrong? uh, nothing we're talking about. ma'am, your speechdoesn't need to be formal. just a few unrehearsed,off-the-cuff remarks. and here they are. great. six decades of service in germany,eastern europe and the middle east, a crewman for a vanderbilt yacht and a writer for timeand the paris review. ezra, you truly are a witness to and a creator ofwhat your first boss, henry luce, called \\\"the american century.\\\" thank you. enjoy your life. and have some cake! yeah, sure, sure. oh, please, don't get up, ezra. i'm very sorry.i was supposed to bring you your gift. but we're a little disorganized today. there's no need to apologize, ma'am.the threat of war with the russians? that's apt to frazzle a person. and on the very daythat the last of the cold warriors shuffles off to buffalo too.how's that for irony? has someone been telling you things? i have seen this movie before,madam secretary. the russian navy holding war gamesin the bering sea. i... i happened to see a little itemon the dod daily rundown this morning. we are sending a naval flagshipinto the black sea. ostrov is posturing on russian tv. and with your husband, no less. he's a handsome fella, by the way. you've cleared your calendar. except for those eventswhere your absence would be noticed. you really do knowhow to read the signs. now, tell that to the dmv.they took my damn license! you still work for me, for the nextseveral hours anyway, right? um... yeah. till five o'clock. so, there's this invisible submarine,a super weapon, it's just sitting there,letting us look at it. right! i was wondering about that too. i mean, why turn offthe stealth technology? well, back in my day, we only tried to readthe russians' intentions. their mentality. to look at the chess playeras well as the pieces on the board. well, that's sort of tough since ostrovwon't even admit there's a game. not even talking. but see,that in itself tells us something. i mean, he's a bully and a poser, right? well, the question iswhy isn't he bragging? throwing this in our face? right... right. why... why not tell the russian public or the whole world, for that matter, that he snuck advanced technology inright under our noses? beat us at our own game. in our backyard. and you're right. you know,it isn't like ostrov to hold back. unless there's somethinghe didn't count on. - something went wrong.- hm-hmm. that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. and again... ostrovwould never admit that, would he? makes you wish it was him sitting herenow instead of me, doesn't it, so you could ask him? you do knowthere's no smoking in here? hm-hmm. oh, yeah, yeah. an ordinance against smokingin this building since 1997, i think. i miss the war. i, too, have great respectfor st nicholas. stop filming.what are you doing here, henry? your tour of the church is over. i mean, st george is great.the warrior saint. the victor. but st nick represents compassion. he's the one you turn towhen times are tough. of course,we've trivialized him in the west, made him into the precursorof our modern-day santa claus. what is your point? thought that maybewe would light a candle together. i don't think so. i'm in no need of miracles.you may be. not me. so, we clear? no more pictures.nothing personal. - no posting where others can see.- and? absolutely nothing involvingthe first family or the white house. - thank you.- ok, then, leave it to me. i'll see what i can do to keep majornews outlets from picking up the story. - without telling mom?- yeah, no. it'll all be fine.besides, the best defense is the truth. and since you and harrisonaren't actually an item... you'd tell me if you were, right?honestly, he is kind of cute. - i mean, i'd understand.- no, i have a boyfriend, ok? - oh, yeah? who's that?- it's just this guy that i work with. another internfrom the microloan program? - uh...- wait, what's with the face? are you, like, dating your bossor something? oh, my god.wait, are you dating arthur gilroy? - yeah. look, i know it sounds...- stevie, no. forget harrison.now we have a problem. mom and dad are fine with it. sort of. they may be fine as parents,but from a press perspective, looking at damage control? there are three wordsthat can never go together in this town, and that is \\\"boss,\\\" \\\"intern\\\" and \\\"sex.\\\" - you've gotta end it. now.- what? why? what do you think will happen whenit comes out about you two? and it will. i will deal with it. the microloan programwas on the chopping block. people would loveto get back at your mother. they'd happily throw arthur gilroyonto the fire to do that. you really thinkthat's what will happen? i know it will. this is st nicholas we're talking about?as in kris kringle? he means something morein orthodox tradition. he's the one you turn toin cases of calamity, when things have turned against you. just an observation,but he seemed like a different person. like he was afraid, even. - afraid of what?- i don't know. but i know when true believersare really praying, and ostrov was. the guy that took me huntingthis afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way. could something have happenedto change that? as a matter of fact, something did. henry, i gotta take thisto the president. if ostrov is scared, it may bebecause he's lost control of that sub. you think he could overreact? that or we will. - at this point, it's academic.- wait. the deadline isn't up yet! i'm overriding it.we've got the russians' response. two battle cruisersand three sister attack subs are on a direct course to glacier bay. carrier strike group is on its way to intercept. the sub hasn't budged. the kirkland's stationed over it, aboutto commence dropping depth charges. why? standard naval etiquette. you don't surrender,we force you to surface. the kirkland.we are directly above the target. we are about to drop depth charges. three, two, one. standing by.something's happening. fish in the water.target has launched a torpedo. initiating countermeasures. we are hit.repeat, the kirkland has been hit. sir, we've lost communicationwith the kirkland. carrier strike group has re-establishedcontact with the kirkland. - damage assessment?- injuries. so far, no fatalities. a visual from a medi-chopper.ship is under power, headed for port. norad reports a squadron of russianmig-35s just performed a flyover. - saw the kirkland take the hit.- damn it! i've got northcom and thecommander of the us pacific fleet requesting immediate authorityto engage. a communiqu\\u00e3\\u00a9 from the russians.their vessel was defending itself. any further attack will be met withquote \\\"overwhelming retaliatory force.\\\" without getting into specifics. call their bluff, sir.they're guilty of an act of war. all due respect,we don't know who's guilty of what. i'm just saying, mr president,before we declare war, let's determine exactlywho we're going to war with. what if that sub hasn't movedbecause it's incapable of moving? what if something went wrong? that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. the captain and crewcould be operating without orders, off the chain of command of the kremlinand his president. what does it matter?we respond to actions, not intentions. we do not let an attackon american lives go unanswered. and we don't go to war over a mistake! outside. ostrov lost control of the yaltabecause your husband knows religion and he saw ostrov ask santa for a wish? the secretary's husband has shownhe can be a pretty effective operative, as well as a religious scholar. well, what if i trust your analysis? say ostrov is scared, operatingin the blind, like we all are here. - then what?- we don't push him to the brink. not until we know more. every second we waitlets those battleships get closer or lets the sub fire another missileor six of them, all of them nukes. if we hit it with one of ours,it's got a 10k reactor on board. we risk sending a radioactive tsunamidown the channel... that'll make fukushima a fond memory.i get it, bess. so, what do you propose? we have to take one last chanceand try and talk to that submarine. directly and without moscow knowing. there has to be a way. that's the unmanned submersible.if the russian crew gets a visual, they'll know it's harmless,incapable of attack. we're tapping on their hull. we're using the retractable armto tap out a message. - morse code.- old school, but it works. we're asking them to statetheir name, mission, allow us on board. that's them answering. there's activity. one of her torpedo tubesis opening, flooding. she's gonna fire. no. it's her distress buoy. they're asking for help. stephanie! are you and harrison dalton dating?is he a good kisser? stephanie, is it true?are you and harrison dalton dating? hey, you ok? yeah, i'm not used to being ambushed. yeah, you've had a lot of pings. you're gettingsome serious unwanted attention. yeah, they were outside my house.and then on the street. it's crazy. don't worry. you and harrison are justfilling bandwidth between kardashians. it's gonna blow over soon.none of this matters. listen to me, what matters is our work. right? the microloans program,that's what matters. yeah, about that... hey, you're not quitting, are you? oh, you're quitting this. us. both. i'm quitting... i'm quitting both. look, once they figure outthat i'm not dating harrison, they're going to figure outwho i am dating. so what? you really wanna throw awayyour whole career on some intern? i know i've harped on this a lot,but i have been around, ok? just let me... let me worry about that. look, ok, you know what?you're too old. you're too old and it's not gonna work. is that what you need to hear? uh, ok. ok. it's been really nice working with you. listen to me, do you really wanna losewhat means so much to you? please, just take a few daysand think about the job, not me. the job. ok. i have to go. see you around, kid. see you around, old man. he's the executive officerof the russian submarine, the yalta. they're transmitting from the bridge. they have an antennaattached to their distress buoy. they suffered a malfunctionwhen the new technology failed. there was a fire in the control room.they couldn't contain it. a loss of oxygen. 42 crew members have already died. that's two-thirds of their crew. the captain broke radio silenceto report it. we received instructions. do not signal for help. do not allow the americans to board. if you can't restore power,then destroy the sub and all evidenceof new deflector technology. anything to keep usfrom getting our hands on it. ask why they fired the torpedo. the captain panicked. he thought they were being attacked. the captain's no longer in commandof the vessel. nice way of saying they mutinied. we only have two hours of oxygen left.we're asking for your help. please help us. please... help us. the russian battle cruiserhas reached our line of quarantine. we tell the russians we're gettingthose men out, they'll refuse. they're close enoughto send out a missile and destroy it themselvesbefore we touch it. so, no good options. ostrov will never admit failure or concedethat one of his crews mutinied. not in public. there may be a way to resolve this. a deal that even he can live with. butwe need to go through back channels. and we happen to have one. we do. it's an interesting offer. president dalton will confirm it's real.you can call him directly. i'm sure it's genuine,but i wonder if there are alternatives. the alternative is a returnto the days of the cold war, sir. there was a time whenour two countries, our two grandfathers, fought on the same side. mine survived a siege too. bastogne. the battle of the bulge. at the end of the war, he exchanged cigaretteswith russian soldiers on the elbe river. traveling here, i thought of him.he would've been happy. he knew first-handwhat our countries could accomplish when they work togetherfor the common good. i wear this in honor of mine. - st nicholas.- my grandfather's name saint. nikolai is an old family name. he, too, may have been happyto see us here in peace. perhaps this iswhat he sacrificed so much for. i will call your president. the fire occurred on the yaltaafter an accidental nighttime collision between the russiannuclear-powered submarine and the us minesweeper kirkland. the disabled sub then driftedinto american territorial waters where us naval personnel boarded itin an attempted rescue. tragically, they found no survivors. - crew members will be buried at sea.- poor guys. what a way to go. i'm just glad that thingsdidn't escalate with russia. - look who i brought.- mr helsinger. - we thought you'd left.- your tour of duty ended yesterday. well, i figured one more daywouldn't matter. also, they told mei still had to pick up my gift. oh, yes, the secretarywanted to give that to you personally. it'll just be a few more minutes. i'll wait. getting used to that, waiting. oh, yeah. interestinghow all that turned out, isn't it? - very sad story.- uh-huh. but defense is handling it.we had nothing to do with it. still, it is very interesting. and it is a story. kind of makes you wonderwhat really happened. hmm. these are all of them? all 20 survivors of the yalta.a few hours ago. being given a top-secretand strictly classified welcome aboard the uss teddy roosevelt. the russians will be announcing thattheir remains have been buried at sea. so we'll leave it to themto make sure the story holds up. as you said,they are good at refuting reality. - ostrov accepted the deal?- yes, sir. they'll all get new lives andidentities, here in the united states. the price for letting us rescue them.unbelievable. in all fairness, sir, we did geta chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealthtechnology before giving it back. at least those poor bastardswon't get sent home and shot for mutiny. but they will never seetheir families again. not even to let them knowthat they're alive. any contactputs their loved ones in danger. all so that ostrovcould save face. hell of a thing. sir, the nato forcesare still deploying to latvia and the yalta situationdidn't spiral out of control. - we won this round.- yeah. the world did not blow up on our watch. for at least another day or two. probably my first day on the job. i could not believei was meeting the old man. - whoa. is that john foster dulles?- yeah. the architect of permanent peacein europe. stood up to soviet aggression. that picture was taken the day presidenteisenhower and secretary dulles signed the treatybringing germany into nato. he always said that,\\\"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the...\\\" \\\"the necessary art.\\\" would you guys give us a minute? - congratulations, sir.- thank you. - a pleasure.- mine. i never even asked youwhere you were going. oh, um... prague. budapest, berlin. you ever thinkyou'd live to see the day when the wall came down,open borders, free elections? sometimes we wondered if we'd liveto see the next five minutes. but somehow we understoodthat if we just kept talking... in the end, the sovietsdidn't want to push that button any more than we did. there was a... a rationality to it,crazy as it seems. mutually assured destruction. yeah, but your new enemies today,they have no such qualms. they wanna push that buttonand there's no holding them back. that's a bit grim, isn't it? i don't know. makes me feel naive for being hopeful. oh, you'll be fine. i've seen a lot of them come and go. i think you're the one for the job. - ezra.- madam secretary. you and i should keep talking. well, for what it's worth,ali feels terrible about \\\"starrison.\\\" i know she does. it's ok. and i'm sorry about \\\"starthur.\\\" let's not go crazy with the names. i think that you did a very adult thing. but i know it was hardand i'm so sorry that you're hurting. - come here.- thanks. - sweetie.- well, at least dad will be overjoyed. but he'll hide it well,which is all you can ask for. hm-hmm. this is nice, by the way. you going to an event tonight? i am. the mccord family dinner.soon as dad gets back. oh. yeah, i don't... i don't knowif i'm up for that. well, get up for it. we're celebrating. - why?- because we can. because we're here. dad's home! come on! get your coats. we founda place with awesome vegan options. - i did.- that's nice. listen, i just want you to knowthat even when it's hard and no matterhow much it hurts right now, it is not the end of the world, ok? where are they? here they are. i missed you guys. what do you think? - oh, i think it's awful.- hi. hi. oh, mom texted me. i'm so sorry, honey. - nice try, dad.- i mean it, honey. - hey...- come on. let's get some food, please. - let's go, guys.- wait. let me just get my coat. - dad, can i wear the hat?- no. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from  \",\n          \"\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bf \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:   previously on reign: lord castleroy. i know i'm notthe man of your dreams. will you accept my humble proposal?

be proud of your sons. i am. forward! no. no... watch out! don't hit lola! i'm fine.i'm not that far along yet. it wasn't so long ago we were alltalking about our first kisses? - now you're all married.- and soon you will be as well. unless i ruin it before then. or my father does. he's arriving today,and i'm worried he'll offend lord castleroywith too small a dowry. we can't afford much. have you told lord castleroyyour family's lost its fortune? he might be understanding. tell a suitor we're broke?my father would have a heart attack. i've had more opportunitiesthan you can count. and what do i do? fall in love with a servantand nearly ruin his life, too. we've all had the same opportunity,and look at us. i never dreamt that i'd be wed toa bastard with an imaginary title. lola's been forced to hide herpregnancy. even mary and francis... yes, when we couldn't cometo terms on my brother, my beloved husbandlocked me in a tower. it's been almost a month. are you and francison any better terms? well, i can now talkto him without screaming. does that count as \\\"better\\\"? your majesty?i have dire news from scotland. it's about your mother,marie de guise. the protestants and theirlords of the congregation have sent an army to besiegemy mother in edinburgh. there are men outside thecastle demanding her surrender. her friends don't know how muchlonger she can hold out for. mary, i'm so sorry. my brother james warnedus that the protestants were planning a rebellionagainst my mother. if i had gone with him,i could have stopped it. or you could've been killed. this news only proves it. it's too badwe couldn't protect my mother by locking her in thetower as you did with me. instead of arguing,let's help her. your mother needs soldiersand quickly. and how are we supposed to get them?certainly not from your father. armies can be bought. who has that kind of money? my mother. francis, i've already askedyour mother. more than once. - she's always said no.- then we will ask her together. and we will keep askinguntil she says yes. mother, we need to talk. i realize that.why do you think i sent for you two? oh, you sent for us?so you've heard the news then? i'm sorry, mary.you must be crushed. well, i'm worried, i'm not crushed. there's still timeto send reinforcements. oh, dear. i don't think we'retalking about the same news. have you not heardabout the succession? whose succession? not yours, i'm afraid. word came from england.it's official. elizabeth will be their next queen. - mary tudor's dead?- no! the old bitch is stillclinging to her miserable life. but she managed to cough up the gallto hand over her crown to elizabeth. a bastard, a protestant no less,and not my son's wife! are you even pregnant yet? could you possibly beany less use to france? do not talk to my wife that way.she's a queen and an ally. she was supposed to get me england! we've been feedingand housing this ally for most of her pointless life.and what have we gotten? a drain on our treasure and army, an endless paradeof dramas and headaches. scotland protects france by engagingthe english on two fronts so it cannot focus its forceon growing its foothold on your backyard, calais. i don't need a lecturefrom you on geography. scotland cannot bluntthe english threat alone, your grace. - especially not now!- yes, i've heard all about it. protestants threatening your mother.she needs reinforcements - just like always.- no, not just like always. she is under siege.there are soldiers at her gates! and now you're afraidyour poor mother might die? well, don't we owe itto scotland and france, as rulers, to ask if thatmight be a good thing? your mother can't handlethe job that you gave her. or else she wouldn't be under siege! father, stop this. mary's crown is at stake,which puts france at risk as well. more than her crown is at stake. your mother failed us completely. and now they wanther head on a pike. be careful. or yours might follow. no one? not one country or lord offers help? my mother is a catholic ally. she is under attack. enemies screaming for her head,and no one cares? scotland has many friends at court. but every conversation i have with anoble or diplomat ends the same way. \\\"we're with you, dauphin,but what does the king say?\\\" i hope you didn't tell them. mary, i should neverhave let my father... words don't bother me. you are safe in this castle. - not even my mother...- threats don't bother me, either. losing bothers me. - mary, that's silly, you're...- a queen? yes, i am. but one with scant power here. and less every day back home. on the other hand, i'm also queenbecause i'm a de guise. i have very powerful uncles. i hope you're not thinking... my mother is surroundedon all sides. protestants are burningand pillaging catholic churches. why would they stop theircampaign of destruction before making sure i losemy mother and my crown? but the duke of guise? ever since you've been back at court, you've chosento keep your distance from him. the same as my parents have. your uncle is a dangerouslyambitious man, who has built himself an army bystealing recruits from their mothers. and paying them well. do you know anyone elsewith an army as large or as loyal? loyal to him. and him only. is that someone that you can trust? he is my uncle. if that doesn't buy mehis loyalty, well... trust is a luxuryi can no longer afford. sorry, you're not to be letin under any circumstances. do you know who i am? you're the contest winnerthe king enjoyed. and then cast aside. penelope, what are you doing here? surely a bounty of demeaning tasksawaits you in the kitchen. - i need to see the king immediately.- hmm. i'm pregnant. with his child. you're not pregnant. even if you are,it's not with the king's child. well, the king will want to know. he's going to wonder if he's gotanother chance at happiness. another chance at a childhe could truly love! shut her up now. henry, i love you and i miss you!and i'm carrying your child! you're pregnant? you're certain it's my child? there's been no one else,your majesty. - i was a maiden when you took me.- oh, that's nonsense. see that she's taken care of. set her up with a cottagein one of the villages. oh! i have some mistresses. in bernay, i think. the child could havesiblings to play with, huh? wait. that's all i get? henry! it's more than you deserve. are you sure you wantto be playing this game? if you overplay it, if he losespatience with your displays, you won't like how it ends. the two dead girls before you didn't. nothing bothers me more than problemsi've already solved coming back to be problems again. if that's what you makeof yourself, my child, expect me to make youa lesson to my other problems by grinding you into the dustyou no longer see fit to sweep. oh-oh-oh!oh, i've missed you two so much! father. where's mother? she's at homewith your other sisters. i've only brought these twoso you could introduce them to potential suitors. aren't they a little youngto be looking for husbands? considering all thetrouble we've had with you, i regret not bringing them sooner. and i hope you haven't made toolarge a mess for me to clean up. i realize i made a mistake, but it'snot as bad as you may have heard. no? tell me, will there be any surprises for lord castleroyon your wedding night? anything he can accuse you of later? no, it didn't go that far. does that embarrass you? then imagine howit embarrassed the family. i may sound harsh,but it's for your own good. you can't affordto lose another suitor. do i have it wrong? no, father. i stopped by our new houseon the way back. it needs workbefore we can live there. especially if we want tobring it to your standards. bash, that's lovely,but what happened out there? you've been outin those woods for weeks hunting that creature.have you found it yet? the darkness? no sign of it yet,but it's only a matter of time. the blood wood is vast,but not limitless. have you been all right? i hope there haven't beenany more encounters with the king. i've been staying out of his way. waiting for you to return. why do you stop? it's not our first kiss.you're my husband, it's all right. it's not as though i'm inexperienced. i'm well aware of that. well, if you wanted a virgin... no, i don't.but i care about your experience. i know not all of it has been good. there's no changing that now. i disagree. what are you doing? helping you forget everythingand everyone that's come before this. tell me what you want... very specifically.leave nothing out. all right. do you have any ideawhat you've done? francis, you should havetalked her out of this madness. you should have helped her. i know you're a student of history. perhaps you missed this chapter: the duke was dismissedfrom your father's court for grasping at too much power. and you know what he did then? he fielded that armyto grasp at more. he's a vicious self-serving killer,a threat to any throne. coming from you,that's a ringing endorsement. i wouldn't be so smug, my dear. you just let the devil into our home. thank you so much for coming, uncle. we wish it was underbetter circumstances. like your wedding, perhaps? i seem to have missed my invitationto that happy event, your grace. the wedding was very rushed.i hope you took no offense. nonsense. don't troubleyourself over niceties. i don't. dauphin. the king and queensend their regards. they regretnot greeting you personally, but urgent mattersdemand their attention. you don't have to make excuses. i'm aware of your parents'opinion of me. and from what i hear,even when your father is present, the king is no longer in the castle. i don't know what rumorsyou've heard, sir, but... call me christian,and let's spare ourselves lots of pointless formalityand posturing. i have friends who tell mewhat goes on in this castle. i know why you asked for me, and i'm here toget you out of the hole my sister's incompetence put you in. very well, no posturing. my mother is in danger,but i'm guessing that it will take more thanfamily loyalty to buy your help. so what will it be? money? land? neither. your father dismissedme from court years ago. i want a position in court again. a more permanent one. lord magistrate of france will do. the lord magistrateis the king's right hand. you want a better position thanthe one that you were stripped of after you challenged your king? i didn't challenge my king,i served him. by appointing generalswithout his permission and doling out political patronageto your friends? while your father was busy producingheirs, bastards and otherwise, he needed my help,whether he cared to admit it or not. he needed your loyalty, whetheryou cared to provide it or not. i can make your army serveme for nothing if i wanted. i have that authority. they're right outsideif you'd like to try. i just don't know how many will stillbe around tomorrow if i'm not. they're loyalto the man who pays them, not the boy who waves crowns at them. we'll consider the termsand present them to henry. uncle. your father will never agree. he has to. or you'll lose scotland,and so will we. hurry up!i mean, i want you and everything, but we must be quick. what's the meaning of this? sorry, your majesty, i was just... i know what you were just,you vile little man. have you no decency? laying your handson a favorite of your king? leave, before i have youthrown in the dungeon! i hope he didn't hurt you. - no.- i got here just in time, didn't i? if that man had had his way, he'd be able to claimyour unborn child, and where would thatleave you with the king? i'm already pregnant.my child is the king's. then i'm sure you'll agreeit's not just yourself that you need to protect anymore. the life of the king'sunborn baby is at stake. we simply can't risk that. you need to go somewhere safe. the king will be outragedwhen he finds out you're locking meand his baby in here. no, the king will be outragedwhen \\\"his\\\" baby comes out looking more likeone of his stable boys. or, more likely,no baby comes out at all. neither of those things will happen. enjoy your solitude, my dear. i'll drop by every month or so to share in the joy ofwatching your belly grow. wait! don't leave me here! a word of advicefrom someone who knows: don't make friends with the rats.they bite. wait, wait. greer tells me her sisters havenever been to a castle before. i say we give them the royal tour. that can wait. i'd like to discuss the matterof greer's dowry as soon as possible. now? in front of your daughters? we don't need to discussgreer's dowry. i've given the matter some thought,and i'm not interested. not interested? then what is it you want? only your blessing for her hand. you have it, my lord. i can't tell you how happythat makes me. i need to speakwith you, father. it's urgent. - nothing is more urgent than war.- i agree. that's why i came to discussa solution for scotland. all this time we've been waitingfor mary tudor to give us england. to allow us the privilegeof putting your wife on the throne. but the english don't wait. they take what they want,just like they took calais from us. so i'm going to take it back. after that,i'll take all of england. we'll attack from scotlandin the north and calais in the south. when they wake up tomorrowto see french soldiers massing around calais,we might even get lucky. they might surrender to sparethemselves certain defeat. tomorrow? how could you...? i can't wait to see thelook on mary tudor's face when i claimthe english throne for myself. i just hope that sick cow liveslong enough for me to execute her. father, tomorrow? - what have you done?- can't you read? general brantome's men are movingnortheast from rouen as we speak. general brantome? i had to relieve laval.no imagination. no courage. stop babbling, father,and tell me the truth. - did you do this?- why wouldn't i? we don't have the strengthto take calais. our armies are spread too thin,all over europe! if we lose,and they capture our forces, they can stage an invasion andsweep down through france unopposed! but francis, we can't lose! yes, we can, and we will! father, thousands will die. you don't understand. \\\"blessed be the lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.\\\" i prayed for his guidance, and he spoke to mein a glorious waking dream. he said that i wouldclaim victory at calais! son, be happy with me! thanks to your father,you are going to rule half of europe! francis? what's the matter?you look like you've seen a ghost. i have.it's father, he's gone utterly mad. define \\\"utterly,\\\"because this is a man who's ridden a pigthrough the throne room in nothing but his under things. mother, he is starting a war. - what?- he's attacking calais. oh, francis. your father,is that what he told you? - it's all over his maps.- darling, relax. i've taken general lavalinto my confidence. he knows to do nothingwithout my approval. general laval has been dismissed. brantome's in charge now. who's brantome? oh, yes, i forgot. he's the new one henry brought in to replace laval when herefused to rename the fifth army \\\"god's gauls.\\\" don't worry, brantome's with us. all of these dismissed generals. i'm beginning to guesshow mary's uncle knows so much. what will you do when father realizesyour contravening all his orders? tomorrow he'll beinvading the spanish. the next day the dutch. when he starts rememberingwho he invaded yesterday, perhaps his wits will have returned, and this whole nightmarewill be over. darling, relax. if i left things to chance, we'd still be bowingto queen penelope. i promise, it's under control. for france's sake,i hope you're right. no. not yet. you know, we can stop all this. it worked.i've forgotten all about... you see, i can't even rememberwhat his name is anymore. good. there's still morethat i want you to forget. oh, in that case, i'll forget thatyou told me not to take off my skirt. that's not what i mean. i want you to forget... every boy who ever smiled at you. every man who ever flirted with you. everyone but me. were the guards necessary? surely a messengerwould have sufficed. i wanted to speak to you alone,away from your men. but not away from your men, i see. have you spoken with your father? the king will not agreeto the position you want. you never asked him, did you? we both know it was a fool's errand. there is something elsethat you want from me. are you going to tell me,or am i meant to guess? wise men look to the future. they're patient. when i started to buildmy army a decade ago, other men saw a ragtag rabble. i saw what it would become: a bargaining chipthat would one day bring kings to me, begging for favors. you never expected to befather's lord magistrate. you want to be mine, when i'm king,even if you have to be patient. i won't have to be patient for long,i don't think. is it poison, i wonder,that is driving him mad? i don't trust youand i don't like you. well, being liked is a king's job,not his lieutenant's. everything in me saysi should say no. and yet you are here...away from your wife. i think you knewyou might have to say yes, and she would object. she would pay any priceto save scotland, but would never ask you to. she knows how your familyfeels about me. well, you've just explainedto me why i love her. enough to have her lockedin a tower, i've heard. do you want this positionor don't you? i want the chanceto serve a great ruler. great rulers aren't afraid ofthe truth, no matter how painful. the truth is, you love your wife. the truth is, she needs me. so what will it be... my prince? when i am king,the position is yours. but i have one condition. your men will report to meas they would to you. - but why would you need my men to...- i'm going with you to scotland. well, that's unwise. and if you die,your promise to me is worth nothing. well, then,i suggest you keep me alive. are you serious? my uncle agreed? he'll send enough men to scotlandto quell the rebellion and save my mother? yes. i'd almost lost all hope. francis, how did you manage it? i convinced the dukethat it was in his best interests. - i'll explain when i'm back.- back? back from where? i am going with him to scotland. what? francis, no. mary, i have to. it's the only way that i canassure your mother's safety. and what of your safety? well, the duke getsnothing if i don't survive. with a man like that,i can't imagine a better guarantee. francis, i don't know what to say. you're saving my country,my mother, and you're risking your lifein the bargain. you needn't say anything. i've only kept my promise. as a king and a husband. you've done so much more than that. i'm not complaining, but... i thought you wantedto take things slowly. not anymore. i'm here now. out with it. there was never a baby. that took less time than i thought. please can i keep workinghere in the castle? i'll empty chamber pots,i'll muck stalls, anything. oh, stop groveling. as much as it warms me to hear it. i may have other uses for you. - other uses?- i have ladies, technically, they're my friends,none of whom i trust. because they're womenwho sleep with men for a cause. much like you did with the king. only it would be my cause. i promise you'll enjoy it morethan emptying chamber pots. i'm gonna send you toa lady i know in italy. you'll be taught proper manners,and the art of deception. and if you work hard, you may bewelcomed back in the castle as a member of my flying squad. this is where you thank me. thank you, your majesty. uh... that will need fixing, too. my family has owned successfulmines for generations, and i'd always hoped topass that expertise on to my son, but unfortunately,i've had only daughters. take the dumfries mine, it's returned 20 tonsof copper a week for years. a perfect investmentfor a man such as yourself. lord castleroy does quite wellin the spice industry, father. why would he want to invest in minesall the way over in scotland? you can't want me towaste lord castleroy's time explaining things that arebeyond your intelligence. do i have it wrong? i think you do, sir.quite wrong. i think you forget you're no longersimply addressing your daughter, but my future wife. and i'm sorry to say that'snot your first mistake. i've done research on your mines,and dumfries... has been played out for years. much like the rest of your holdings. now, let's look atsome different figures. as part of our marriage settlement,i will provide 10,000 francs to each of greer's sistersto be used as their future dowries. this will allow your daughtersto marry men of title and fortune, making you and your family wealthy. that is what you want, isn't it? uh... there is just one condition. greer will have final approvalover her sisters' marriages, so she can see to it thatthey marry men they love, not those forced on them. why are you doing this? a good businessman always knowswhat something is worth. and to me, greer is priceless. i never meant for youto go to war for me. when are you goingto realize that i love you, and i'll do anything for you? darling, let me be gratefulfor what you've done without making promisesyou can't keep. what you did was extraordinary. i think maybe when i return, you won't be the only onewaiting for me. you're suddenlyvery sure of yourself. i am. but just to be safe. look at me. am i the only one in this bedwith something to forget? what do you mean? when you're with me, i want to be the only oneinside your head. i want you to look into my eyesand see only me. i want you to alwaysremember what i feel like. so when you're using yourfingers for some other task, you wish they weretouching me instead. i will. i want you to always remember whatit feels like to be with your wife. ah, my wife and my son. closest family i have in this world. sharing my castle,my blood, my legacy. why would you lie to me? what do you mean? don't bother addingmore lies to the pile. i know what you've done.you've kept me caged up in this place like one of your song birds. sending in generals to humor me. don't blame mother when you've been hatching plans to attackhalf of europe. they aren't plans anymore! french forces marchedfor calais this morning. they're already halfway there. you think i'm delusional? read these dispatches. they aren't from anyof your performing generals. what happened to general brantome? i've sacked them all.we don't need any generals. not when we have a kingto lead our men. i leave tonight to join the invasion. oh, dear. no trousers. this keeps happening. i realize now that you twowere only trying to protect me. guarding my legacy. but that's my job, not yours. i will not be rememberedas king henry, ruler who dreamed of conquest. i'll be remembered asking henry, conqueror. greatest military strategistsince hannibal. henry, darling, you're not well. i have headaches!you know what else i have? the backing of god. francis, please,talk some sense into your father. it's too late.we can't stop the invasion. and anyway, father's right. what? we can take calais. any fool knows he can't do that. it's true, father's armywould fail on its own. but two armies. one marching head on. the other across this frozen marsh, flanking the english from behind. do you mean the duke's army?mary's army? mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that? my son, making history with me, just like i've always dreamed. i wanted to apologizefor my behavior earlier. i hope i wasn't out of line. it's my father who should beapologizing, though he never would. no one's ever stood up for me likethat before. or for my sisters. i was surprised to see how quietyou acted around your father. i've come to ratherenjoy your usual nature. outspoken, bold. how long have you knownthe truth about us? i've known for some time. as a businessman,i always do my research. but as a gentleman,i wasn't about to bring it up. and as your future husband,you should know i'm... too rich to care. i can't thank you enough. no need to thank me. everyone deserves a chanceto find happiness. just as i have. which brings me to this, i havesomething i'd like you to look over. but promise me you won't sign ituntil you're ready. this is our wedding contract. yes, and since you're now in charge of all marriagecontracts for your family, it means nothingwithout your approval. is something wrong? no, that felt surprisingly right. so you are takingmy mother's last hope, leaving her to the mercy ofthousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown. mary, please understand. i do understand. you're doing what you thinkis best for your country. not only my country. if france is beaten at calais,your country will suffer, too. - france can hardly defend scotland.- defend scotland? when have you ever defended scotland? except with brave words? - that is not fair.- now you want fair? we are rulers, not schoolchildren. blood will be spilled becauseof the choice you have made, - my mother's blood.- you don't know that. but the blood of thousandswould be spilled... - yes, french blood, i know.- i do not only think of france! no, you do not. but you do put her first. as any king would. then can you forgive me? it is myself i cannot forgive. i've made an awful mistake. our marriage was an awful mistake. please don't say that. there were a thousand momentswhere i could've done something. made secret treaties, sold favors, even snuck away to scotlandto be with those people who need me. and do you know why i didn't? because i love you. because i am your wife. mary, listen,when we have taken calais, the first thing i will dois travel to scotland with your uncle's army. we can still save your mother. like when you promised you wouldtake me to scotland with my brother? like when you promised soldiersthe time before that and the time before that? you make it sound like every promisei make is an empty one. what other promise can you make? you are the future king. it's not that simple. maybe it should be. for both of us. what does that mean? nothing. i don't know. i'm only going to asktwo things of you. the first is that youstop making me promises you know in your heartyou can't keep. and the other? come back to me. live through this battle. and don't let england cost me you. forward! have faith, mary.francis is clever and strong. he'll return home safely. i hope so. but even if he survives, our marriage is... what? francis is tryingto save his country, and i can forgive him for that, as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needsto be done for scotland, whatever that may be. what if he can't forgive you? well, that will just be too bad. i won't let him putmy country at risk again. watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

- what are you investigating?- is tatsumura involved? there are rumors that sanritsuindustries is behind all this. isn't its president tatsumurathe mastermind behind this incident? aren't you flooded with complaints aboutpolice ineffectiveness in the case? they say the authorities are toocautious, or worse, weak-kneed. i'll ask you the same question:what do you guys think? it's easy to criticize others. but are you trying to bring backthe old, heavy-handed police power? it's not as if cautiousinvestigation is bad. and that's part of thedifficulty of this job. it's not you who's been getting yourmen killed at every turn, it's me. oh, hi. the press? yeah. i got a little excited. i went to the farewell ceremonyfor detective sugiyama. i see. well. that's three in a row. - what a shame.- yeah. and...the meeting? it's like we've hit a dead end. we don't have a concrete plan. all the violent incidentsin this neighborhood are connected tosanritsu industries. i'm sure i'm onthe right track, but i don't know where to startto catch them by the tail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 we don't have a single clue. we're helpless. it's our own faultthat the city is calling us weak-kneed. the three men who diedwould turn in their graves. sanritsu industriesbusiness information chairman saichi sakurapresident j\\u00e5\\u00aago tatsumura i just had an idea. i heard a rumor on the street. tatsumura has recently takencomplete control of the organization. they say things are gettingawkward with his uncle, sakura. mmm-hmm... so? if we can crack the organization bysuccessfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get someclues for the investigation. i see. but that would require-- of course.we can't do it alone. we really need the help of a manknowledgeable about the organization. mmm-hmm. a kind of guerrilla operation. interesting idea, but i don't know if there's anybodywho could be that useful. i actually have a littlebit of an idea about that. oh? who is it? tojima brothers hello! hello! coming! oh! old man! hi. hi. welcome. - are you two working together?- no. she wouldn't stop askingme to show her how to fix it. boy, you look terrible! oh! did you have the ceremony yet? no, not yet. it seems rather sillyto call it a wedding now, but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - we'll invite you when we do, mr. ogata.- sure. - please come in.- okay. it looks like two more cars have beenadded after not coming here for a while. but the two drivers are unavailable,so they're just like decorations now. - please have a seat.- okay. hard-working, kind-hearted\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 she'll make a good wife. yeah... i suppose so. so, what broughtyou here today? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 it's kind of hard to saywhat i'm asking you to do. actually, i just wanted to askyou to go back to the old you. - the old me?- yes. a yakuza. old man, don't jokearound with me. i wouldn't joke aboutasking you to do this. please... i really need your help! what's the story? you want me to be a g-man. you're no strangerto tatsumura. i would like to ask you to do this. and let me assure you, this isn't about saving theface of the police or anything. we have to crush that germ-likeorganization as soon as possible. old man, if you want to talk about that,please take it up with someone else. i'm asking because i knowi can count on you. it's not a job thatjust anybody can do. don't give me too much credit. i'm not that respectable. but-- first of all, i don't want to doanything that'll open old wounds. okay. maybe i shouldn't haveasked you to do it. why don't you get outof this business? i'd be happy tohelp you find a job. it would be my pleasure. but i'm a man with no education at all living only for this jobsince i was a simple police officer. the grime sticks anddoesn't seem to come off. i might have to die to get it clean. i'm sorry i can't help you. it's okay. i'll definitelyattend your wedding. yeah. bye. oh? is mr. ogatagoing home already? - yes.- oh. what was that about? it has nothing to do with us. yes, this is tojimatransport co. huh? what's up? it's the usual\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - hello.- how's it going? are you ready toaccept our protection? i refuse. i don't wantto be under your care. think carefully about it. without a driver there wouldn'tbe any business, you know. what? what did he say this time? don't worry about it. huh? the car's back. oof! brother! - osamu!- osamu! what's wrong? he said he gotjumped by thugs. - thugs?- yeah. - let's go inside to treat the wound.- yes. so when did you get out?

i'm not going to fight. i'm going now because they'reprobably waiting for me. you're free to quit. you can take yoursalary up to today. bro! bro! i'm disappointed in you, bro. where's the brotherthat i used to know?

yeah, i thought about that. but if the cops are there allday long, no customers will come. they predictedthat much, all right. do you know which groupthe thugs belonged to? they belong to the takedafamily down the street. i think sanritsu industries is themastermind behind the protection racket. i heard that thetakeda family's boss became a shareholder ofsanritsu industries the other day. i think that's fishy. i didn't know that. a champion, huh?

they're all gone. how did that happen? well... a series of disturbancesthe other night, you know, bartenders running away,waitresses being taken\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 even the debt was takenover by sanritsu industries. the former championis no longer in shape! i'll give them all to thatbastard tatsumura! i'll explain later, but i wantyou to come to my place tonight. hey, sis! my brother's back! honey, those people havecome to pick up the truck. did you really sell it? yeah, we've alreadymade the deal. please take it! hey, why are you doing this?what are we going to do now? i'm sorry to break it to you, but i've decided togo back to my old life. what? you'll have to live in theapartment for a while. that's the brother i know! sorry, but there's a world of men thatwomen don't understand. right, bro? you go live with her.and get a job. that's stupid! please, please don't do it. did you forget whathappened four years ago? didn't you almost die tryingto crawl out of the muck? don't get desperate just becausethings aren't working here. we can go somewherewhere there are no yakuza. please, please don't do it. i'm sorry, but i'vemade up my mind. this time i'm goingto do it my way. that's right!that's right, brother! but you can't do it alone, bro.hey, please, let me do it. i'll bring my friendsif you want. idiot! i said no, you can't do it. pack your bags with her. i've now given youthe gist of it. i'd really like somehelp from you all. i just want to assure you thatwe're subcontracting for the police. it's low-pay despite the risk. i'd like to know if you'restill willing to take it on. please don'thesitate to tell me. when you say subcontracting forthe police, how will you start? first i'll pretend to makea comeback to the yakuza. then i'll infiltrate their organizationunder the guise of a turf war. that would meanwe're the tojima family. gentlemen, this is theperfect role for you. if you look in the mirrori think you'll see what i mean. i don't want to flatter you, buti'd hardly call you all good citizens. but it takes a hell of a lot ofguts and horsepower to hit them. you're all perfect teammembers in that regard. hey, bro, even though it's police work,we're putting our lives on the line. there will be a littlereward, won't there? i can't guarantee that. i'm sure you'llmanage it just fine. but don't forget there'sa policeman next to you. so let's hear your answer. can you guys give me a hand? let's show them what we can do! i'll get tatsumura backfor his protection racket. how about you, matsushima? well, i'm being askedto take care of the car. i don't see anyoneelse qualified. goro? i'll do my best tosave the extra money. mr. policeman? it's my duty soi'll do whatever-- you scared me! - osamu!- brother... don't treat me like a stranger! everyone, i'm hisbrother, osamu kaji. we're actually half-siblings. how many timeshave i told you? i'm not gonnamake you one of us. again with that.i wish you'd trust me. but a goofball like youwould be the first to get hit. i can't take careof a guy like that. well, then, brother.you mean you can't-- you'd be slowing me down.give it up. fine, then!i'll do my own thing! osamu... osamu! he's just like you the way he won'tback out of something once he's said it. he's a real pain in the ass. so everything isokay then, right? okay, now let's get to work. first you'll go out and spread wordthat i'm making a comeback. tojima brothers \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by pistol. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by tommy gun. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by dynamite. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa everybody, everybodydisappears in a puff of smoke \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa with water. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when the blood lefton the bed dries up \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa there, i hear it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that rhythm \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa sing it! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa dance all you want! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa jam session on anenchanting night \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa i'm drunk and i'm all alone \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa may i sit here? if you don't mindme sitting with you. would you like tobuy me a drink? in return, you tell mewhose territory this is. you sure aren'ttight-lipped, are you? i'll have what he's having. i hear a retired yakuza namedtojima is making a comeback. well. i'm sure there willbe an uproar now. i don't thinktatsumura will allow it. but tojima and tatsumuramust have been like brothers. people only think that's true. they don't get alongwith each other very well. i'm telling you thisfor your own good. if you want to make a living as ayakuza, it's smarter to join tatsumura. thanks for the advice. if you want, i can askthe higher-ups for you. did tatsumura ask youto scout for the yakuza? huh? you'll have to ask tatsumura if you can hirea guy named tojima. then you're\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 next time you see me,call me tojima. recreation center construction who are you? you almost got yourself killed. do you know what'sgoing on here? i do, but thanks anyway. don't get me wrong. i'm here to kill you.don't move! do you recognize this face? five years ago\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 five years ago? in a turf war on the beach,you shot a guy named kuroki. then you're kuroki's-- i'm his younger brother. now that you remember,i'm going to kill you. wait! that wasn't supposedto be a fatal injury. no respectable doctorwould've treated that wound. it's no wonder it was fatal. i made a vow then. i swore i'd kill youif i ever saw you! are you hurt? you think you saved me? that doesn't make upfor my brother! wait a minute! i get how you feel, buti've got a job i've got to do. i won't let you stop me. - boss, are you hurt?- i'm fine. the advertisement worked 100%. i've already gota lot of sponsors. that's the guy. him? a debt is a debt. i'll wait untilyour job is done. in exchange, i'm not leavingyour side for a while. i won't let you dieuntil it's by my hand. so you're a bodyguard. well, okay. he's an old friend of mine.try to get along. starting tomorrowwe're going to be busy. sanritsu industries boss, tojima is here. what do you want to do? i thought they'dbe here by now. hey. to what do we owethis surprise? it's been a while. how's your shippingcompany doing? i heard you were happy togetherwith the previous boss's daughter. i don't think i can makea living as an honest man. i'm going backto the old tojima. i see. that's why you came allthe way out here to say hello. shimadzu. let's celebratetojima's comeback. book a welcome home party-- you already threw mea welcome home party. a fancy one with lead bullets. i know it was supposedto be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. tojima.... you've become nastierliving as an honest man. i'm not as bad as you. you took over this buildingin less than four years? i was hoping you'd tell mehow to make money. that's the kind of advice one canonly get from a professional. i wish you'd stopwith the innuendos. sanritsu industriesis a legitimate company. and we pay our taxes. if you want, you cango ask the tax office. but i hear there's a lot of money to bemade without the tax office knowing. what do you mean? for example...protection rackets. that sort of workfits these guys. don't move! what's this? a raccoon dog's tail? i'm the one who built all this. i have some allies,but also many enemies. you can never be too careful. everyone, leave us. i think it's time tocut to the chase. i'm being extorted, it seems. no, i just need a little help. it's a lot of work to make upfor four years of absence. i'd like to borrow your territoryfor a while, for old time's sake. sorry, i don't have anythinglike that right now. i have enough to eat running atheater and a recreation center. oh yeah? that's a relief. then i'll make my ownterritory without reservation. that's all well and good,but be careful. they say once a boxer retires,he never makes a comeback again. jinxes can be brokensomeday, you know. well, look forward to it. i see. tojima has shown up so now tatsumura hasmore things to worry about. that's why he tried toget rid of him last night. that was a screw-up,out of character for tatsumura. i'm getting lucky. it's good to live a long time. you've pit the two against eachother for your own advantage? i'm the one who originally createdsanritsu industries, after all. i didn't want to keep it intatsumura's care forever. so... shall we propose the election of a newpresident at the next general meeting? no, i think we'll waitand see what tojima does. - chairman!- hmm? mr. tojima has cometo say hello to you. good thing he came now. have him come over here. mr. chairman,it's been a while. yeah, a while. i hear youmade a comeback the other day. yeah. i'll needyour help again. yeah, sure. but now i'mpractically retired. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 i heard a rumor that you'll be returningas president of sanritsu once again. there are too manyirresponsible rumors out there. i agree. i was even gossipingwith tatsumura just now. with tatsumura? they sayyou had a dispute last night. that's just anotherirresponsible rumor. but you better be careful. it's weird saying thisto your face, i've always preferred youto tatsumura. if you ever need help,i'm always here for you. oh. i'll see you, then. well, i'll leave youalone for today. this is a fine housefor an old fox's nest. and they're even planningto expand the place. sanritsu industries i see. that old manand tojima, huh? i think we can still dosomething about it now. you're something yourself too. what are you after? the sakura family's territory? well, if that's on the table. okay. i'll grant you that. in exchange, get to work. eliminate the old man. boss. he's your blood relative. i don't remember havingan uncle like that. murakami. take the kijima brothers. mr. chairman. these men say that theycame from tatsumura. what do they want? can't you handle it yourself? no, i definitely can't. what are you doing?stop it, you! chairman of sanritsuindustries murdered killing anyone whogets in the way? but this is too much! this is exactly howtatsumura works. now their organizationis strengthened again. we have to find anew way to get inside. welcome. can iget you a drink? i don't have any money.here, let me pay with this. we're supposed to ask for cash. don't be so uptight. i heard whoserestaurant this is. welcome. eh? are you the onei need to talk to? maybe. we'll see. boy, where are you from? check the family register.no comment. well?! i want a clear answer! come this way. here. the pistol. wait here. manager's office i have someonewe could use. we heard your story. - go home for today.- what? we have to check if the gunhas been used in a crime. if you can't tell by holding it,then you're an amateur. what? that gun isn't loaded. you're not qualifiedto be a bouncer. move! are you the boss? if you really want to workhere, do as you're told. waving that thing aroundwon't get you anywhere. got it? got it. nice to meet you. the takeda family controlsthe bar area here. the bars and cabarets in this areaare the yoshi family's territory. both are backed bysanritsu industries, i'm sure. just as i thought. so what's the connection betweentatsumura and the owners? it doesn't seem to bejust protection rackets. i bet they're into somethingmore profitable than that. okay. this istheir turf, anyway. let's provoke them one by one. tojima's taking over this bar.get lost, goons! motherfucker! get him! what the hell, you guys? the tojima family's takingover this place now. if you want protectionmoney, we refuse! what?! - how did you do?- good. ah. now the takedafamily's stronghold. let's all go together. - what's that?- i got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weirdsymbols in the purchase column. let's check thenext place too. go back and tell your boss. tojima is taking overthis business for a while. it'd be interesting tofind a similar ledger. - let's check around.- yeah. somewhere like in here? this is why amateursare no good. leave these thingsto the professionals. it's just beenhigh school so far. now comes the college class. find anything? nothing of value. it's written thesame way as this. what could this mean? i'm sure it has somethingto do with their organization. six people. just six people and they'reraiding turf all over the place. and what do you want me to do? i'm truly ashamed. actually, i'm going totake care of this right now. i just wantedto let you know. in that case,leave him be. let him do histhing for a while. but that's-- don't you get it? what's a couple ofcabarets and bars? the point is to keep ourorganization unnoticed. wait and see what they uncover. sanritsu industries - hey.- huh? so what are they doing? they're not moving at all.the car's crying. we'll let it rest while it can. what the hell is going on? he's wearing a sanritsu badge! who are you calling? oh, it's you, bro! don't scare me! - i was just about to call you--- come here. what the hell is going on here? i used my brain a little. not many people know thatyou and i are brothers, right? because we havedifferent last names. so i figured it was up to me tosneak into tatsumura's place. i told you that you can't. it's too late. i'm in. so you don't wantto hear what i got? you got something? actually, i'm justabout to get it. idiot. you've got me beat. well then, brother! but be careful, you'retalking with the enemy. if you're as careless as youwere just now, you're dead. they're totally systematic. in that organization, unless you're a real old-timer,you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t figure out anything. it seems so. i tried to step on his incomestreams, but it didn't work so well. i'm sure he's got somebig source of money. i'll find it eventually. see you later, brother. all right, place your bets! but think carefullybefore betting. watch closely! here we go. that one. you choose this one? are you sure this is the one? too bad! i feel bad abouttaking from a cop. okay, one more time! we have a visitor. hey, stop. they've been going to barsand cabarets for a while. they don't seem to becollecting laundry. what are they doing? okay, i'll find out. give me a hand. hey, can i get a light? thanks. hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, what do we do? what do we do? good! it's a red light! you stupid bastard,you had me worried. i see. so the dry cleanerwas a collector. yeah. but where is thatmoney coming from? a bag this big witha bunch of bills in it. and instead of laundry,there's a load of whiskey. a daihatsu midget,whiskey, and wads of cash\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what kind of mystery is this? we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to poke around more. come on. come on. i went to see mr. ogata. i was hoping to askmr. ogata to stop you. and he told me the truth. you should have just told me. am i such an unreliable woman? no. this is my problem. i thought i'd washed my hands of thebusiness, but they don't respect that. i had to do it. to break free. i understand. but this is not just about you. good luck. you're doing a goodthing for the world. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 don't overdo it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i lie in bed, there's a man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i drink wine, there are two men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i walk down the street,there are three men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all stare at me, dead \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa boss, tojima is here. what? okay. i'll check it out. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa the people who loved me \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all disappear \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa little red flowers in the heartare hickeys made of lead bullets \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa what's up? are you stillscouting for recruits? not anymore. i found a really good warrior. i think you're inthe wrong place. is that so? i think i read the signproperly and i came in. i think the womanmade a mistake too. aren't you just a kid?don't smoke. what? i've got a lead.i'm counting on it. punch me once. you son of a bitch! what should we do? what's he up to? - let's go.- hold on. wait a little longer. - check the moonshine.- got it. i'll leave that to you. oh, hello! metropolitan police? listen, i'm at the\\\"night castle\\\" cabaret! there are drunks rampaging! yes! please come! - you're saved by the bell.- it's a draw. something extra. i wonder if it'sjust a turf war. no, it can't be. moonshine. this was the key totheir secret organization. so, through the bosses ofthe amusement quarters they would get this moonshineinto bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profitdividends to the shareholders. then this ledger is likely arecord of moonshine sales. i wonder how much moneythey can make on this. if they put import priceson such cheap liquor, they'll make twentytimes as much. - twenty times?- and it's not taxed. compared to that, protectionrackets are nothing. in any case, we're going to find out wherethe moonshine factory is. then we can havethem by the throat. first, let's do all we canto find the couriers. wait a second. what's that? they're collectingempty bottles. so they finally have ajob that looks like a job. that's kind of weird. - what?- those two cars behind us. they've been followingus for a while now. here they come! hey! that's one gone! hey! here they come again! damn it! that was close. good job. hey, matsushima, what's wrong? oh! stupid son of a bitch! why didn't you tell me sooner? this car was entrusted to me.i can't leave it with anyone. you're stubborn! what's wrong? we got shot at while tailingthe bottle collection truck! call a doctor! if it gets in the papers,they're gonna find out. it's no time fortalk like that! wait. lay him down over there. stay sitting. don't just stand there.run hot water. will it work? it didn't work outfor my brother. because it was closeto his vital organs. but it's going tobe okay this time. come on, bite down! harder! hey! he only fainted. it's done. so their focus is nowon the organization. by the looks of it, they'redoing a lot of research. maybe he's a rat for the cops. no way. no way would thecops trust a yakuza. but this needs athorough investigation. if he's willing to go so far, i have an idea too. i came here today to talk toyou on behalf of tatsumura. so now you're going to joinme and take down tatsumura? tatsumura wants to havea peaceful talk with you. i'm gonna usethis for a moment. hello. hey, it's me. yeah, i'mgiving him the phone now. it's tatsumura. hello. tojiima? it's me. i don't have anything totalk to you about now. you might not, but i do. say, would you like tohear a pretty woman's voice? what? would you liketo say something? she doesn't seem tohave anything to say. but you're not an idiot. so i'm sure you'llback off quietly. don't give in! all you've donewill be for nothing! akiko! don't worry about me! don't back off for a second! akiko! stop! got it now? back off. hello?! hello?! hell-- damn it! looks like we're done here. well, i'll leave you to it. wait, you son of a bitch! boss... sanritsu industries i'm here to see tatsumura. stay out of this, thugs. mr. tojima.he's waiting for you. excuse me, but i'llhold your things for you. what's up? heh-heh. well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - sis!- don't move! sorry about last night. i didn't mean tomake things worse. i just thought our discussion mightgo better with a woman involved. well, have a seat. we're not supposed to sitdown and talk to each other. i see. well, let's hear youranswer right away. you'll back off,of course, right? i'm not backing off yet. oh... i guess we had it all wrong. we thought you hada thing for that woman. so you don't carewhat happens to her? i'd like to ask yousomething first. do you have the guts tomake a suicide pact with me? a suicide pact? yeah. you wouldn't have the guts. because you havetoo many things. you ruined my business. and you even kidnapped akiko. thanks to you, i'm reallynaked. i have nothing to lose. not even my life. if anything happens to akiko,you can be sure i'll kill you. if you think being surrounded byguns will stop me, you're wrong. i swear i'll get it done. how about it?

why? better calling plan or...?- it's a more secure line. there's nothing covert about this visit. i'm just lecturing about fundamentalismto a bunch of colonels. first of all, it's not just a lecture. these military-to-military exchangeshelp keep the peace. it's a big deal. i feel special again. thanks. you think anyone gets invitedto these things, especially at the behestof foreign minister gorev? guess he forgot i once refusedto give his daughter an a. do the world a favor;don't remind him of that. now, that is a secure line, so that we can, you know, talkwithout any borises listening in. just in case you have trouble stayingwarm on those long winter nights. - i was not sleeping!- you were! - i was meditating.- you were snoring in the middle of... - i was not. was i?- yes! but you find thatincredibly sexy though. - snoring!- come on, it's not an old thing! - it was a... it was a boring movie.- no. come on, i'm so with it.look, come on. look at my phone. look at all theapplications and life hacks i have here. life hacks! - whoa.- what?

- well, who posted it?- alison! alison, it's her account. god, i'm gonna kill her. and that's...that's, that's harrison, right? the president's son? yeah. sort of breaks your heartto see him before all the bad choices. - i don't see what the big deal is.- he's the president's son, ali! that makes it a big deal!plus, he really needs privacy right now. - what does that mean?- just take the picture down! are you freaking out because there issomething going on between you? i already told you, we datedfor three weeks when i was your age. we are just friends.but it is really important to me that he feels like i am someonethat he can trust. - please be more mysterious.- look, i don't want him thinking that i'm going around telling peoplethat i'm \\\"one half of starrison.\\\" and according to this,not the cute half. girls, i'm leaving. come say do svidaniya. let's go say do svidaniya. - morning, all.- morning. nadine tells mei have a very full schedule today. starting with the russian war gamesoff the alaskan coast. they began this morning. a flotilla ofsome 50 different vessels and aircraft. they're technically within their rights. the maneuvers and test firings aretaking place outside american airspace. still insultingly closeto our northern borders. we were expecting something like this.after the nato thing? yes, it's believed to be a responseto our announced deployment of the natorapid response strike force in latvia. which was our response to russia'smeddling in its neighbors' affairs. moldova being the most recent example. white house expects usto send a d\\u00e3\\u00a9marche, a diplomatic cable in protest. the nato force in latviawas the right call. i'm just annoyed that ostrov isso determined to refight the cold war, instead of fixing his crappy economy. don't put that in the protest thingy. speaking of the cold war, there's a ceremony todayfor ezra lyle helsinger, the department'soldest foreign service officer. he's retiring todayafter 60 years of service. wow. 60 years? good for him. i'm sorry. ma'am?you're needed in the situation room. elizabeth. what's up?blake couldn't give me any details. - that's because it's need to know.- ok, what do i need to know? russian war games have gotten heated. one of their subs split from the fleetand crossed into us coastal waters. not unprecedented. russians like to test our defenses,like we test theirs. but we were tracking the suband it vanished. that is unprecedented. so they've perfectedsome kind of cloaking technology. and the sub's nuclear armed. it's somewhere off the alaska shoreline,intentions unknown. could be posturing.could be about to start world war iii. - what's ostrov saying?- we tried calling. we're told he's at a remote location.he can't be reached. so he's vanished. heck of a weekfor henry to go to russia. can't disagree with you there. thank you. professor mccord,you are most welcome. - thank you, minister gorev.- you must call me anton. even after i wouldn't giveyour daughter an a? i overreached in asking.an \\\"incomplete\\\" was generous. well, good.i'm glad we cleared the air on that. as am i. indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetingsbetween our militaries. to keep the air clear. especially in a timeof such unfortunate misunderstandings. thank you very much.it's an honor to be here. i'm gonna speak with you todayabout a subject that is of great importance to our twocountries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfareor struggle. namely, jihad in classical islam and in both eastern and westernchristianity, the concept of crusade. professor mccord, may i introducethe president of the russian federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,pavel ostrov? professor mccord,it is an honor to meet you. it's also my honor, mr president,and a bit of a surprise. i like to come to this placeon occasion for a visit. for the beautiful country,the recreation and for the game. i'm told you enjoy blood sports. if, by that, you mean hunting, then, yes, my father took me sometimes. deer, duck, an occasional squirrel. then you must come hunt with me.no refusing. my pleasure is to showthe goodness of russian life to such eminent, distinguished guest. with such a beautiful, eminent wife. mr president, we've been in contact.they deny that sub is even there. still claiming their rightto refute reality. what do we know about the sub itself? we think it's the yalta, sir.it's a new sub out of vladivostok with experimental stealth technologymore advanced than ours. - apparently.- it's powered by a fission reactor, carrying six bulava-typecruise missiles, each with 150-kiloton warheadand a range of about 60 miles. but again,what is most disturbing about it... besides the fact that it could beon its way to flatten anchorage. is how they have just proven that they can evadeall forms of detection by sonar, magnetic anomalyor satellite array. a true stealth weapon. they can hit usbefore we even know they're there. ostrov's been bankrupting his economy, trying to get back to military paritywith the west. - now he may have it.- they've got the drop on us. what do they want? is ostrov just making us sweator is this more than posturing? sir, if ostrov isn't talking to us,i may know somebody who will. nadine, can you clear my schedulefor the rest of the day? - all of it, ma'am?- and, nadine, quietly, ok? - get gorev on sivits, please.- yes, ma'am. is everything ok, ma'am? yeah, it's fine.i just need to clear my schedule. it's definitely a loose nuke.we're all dead. there's a bunker in the basement. ok, that's enough doomsday.you heard the secretary. let's clear her schedule. quietly. - she's fun!- i heard that. don't try and evade the issue and don't try telling methat this sub isn't there. anton. it's just the two of us now. yes, two friendstalking openly and honestly, but friends also don't put powerfulweapons on each other's borders. hmm. i'm listening.i thought it might come to this. so, say one of our subsdid lose its direction and come too close to your alaskawith its bears and salmon. you're about to put nato troopson the latvian border, just a few hundred miles from moscow. which is less friendly? - so, what can we do about that?- cancel the nato deployment and perhaps the captainwill find his map again. come back home.honest enough for you? perfectly. you also know i'm being honest wheni tell you that bullying and threats will not alter the resolveof the united states or its allies. and your presidentneeds to pick up the phone. i will tell him myself when i see him.he can't have gone far. - what are you talking about?- didn't you know? president ostrov has invited yourhusband henry to go hunting with him. they're in the woods, hunting grouse. one of president ostrov'sfavorite pastimes. it's quite an honor for your husband. is that what it is? i'm certain they're havinga wonderful time. well, all i can say is...they better be. until later, madam secretary. sorry. hunt requires quiet, professor. we are not having very much luck today. maybe the camera crewhave something to do with it. i don't understand. with this gun,i always have very good luck. - oh, it's beautiful.- my grandfather's. he kept it with him in the greatpatriotic war, your world war ii, during the blockade leningrad. - the siege of leningrad?- you know it? yes, of course. through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cockedand loaded by the front door, so if the germans ever break through, if they come to the housefor my aunts and my grandmother, he has somethingto shoot the enemy with. and if necessary...his family and then himself. may i ask, sir,why you're telling me all this? our peopleare never frightened, professor, and we outlast our enemy. so, tell your wife and your president,we don't back down. i will convey your message,mr president. but to be honest, i have no ideawhat you're talking about. don't worry. they will. he did what? yeah.my left ear is still ringing. now i know what that was all about.he was using me for propaganda. let's just hope that's all you are. - you think he'd take me hostage?- i don't know. clearly, he coordinatedthe sub incursion with your visit. it's just optics. lecturingthe secretary of state's husband while his sub is sneaking around alaska? the message is,don't let nato troops go into latvia. well, now that we've heard it,why don't you come home? no, if i cut and run now,he'll just know that we're scared. i should act like everything is fine. they've invited me to touran orthodox monastery of st george. i think i should go. besides,it's a significant historical site, crucial to the spread of christianityduring mongol rule. i am finding your dorkinessoddly reassuring right now. we need you in there. henry, i gotta go. - be safe, ok?- i will. ok. henry alright? as long as the only actual shotsbeing fired are at a bunch of defenseless birds,yeah, i think we're alright. this is ostrov grandstanding.clearly, the man likes to put on a show. what do you propose? if he wants to grandstand,hide and seek with the sub, and whatever he's trying to dowith the secretary's husband, we should put on a show right back. not only mobilizethe strike force to latvia, but deploy the sixth fleet's flagshipto the black sea. turkey will allow it,but it's posturing. it's us doing exactly what ostrovis doing, only bigger and louder. surest sign of strengthis to show you are able to use it. but are we willing to use it, sir? i think we just got a signalthrough your husband, bess. all this russian presidenttruly understands or respects is force. - give the order to move the fleet.- yes, sir. we've cleared the secretary's schedule,but one item's proving tricky. - and that is?- ezra helsinger's retirement ceremony. she's expected to give a speechor at least make an appearance. - today's his last day.- he's a living legend. everyone's gonna be there,including press. m-sec doesn't show, there'll be rumors. i'll let her know. keep it on for now. speaking of rumors, i'm hearingthe pentagon's parking lot is hopping. people coming in insteadof going home? never a good sign. yup, we're all about to be fraggedby a fiery ball of death. it was nice to know you. daisy, something you should see. you know the secretary'sso protective of the family? \\\"let them say what they will about me, so long as they leavethe kids out of it?\\\" the kids are not out of it. well, the secretary'snot gonna love this, but it just looks likeyour typical internet rumors. daisy, you have a phone call. - it's the secretary's daughter.- or not. she's at the mouth of glacier bay, resting on a seabedin 100 meters of water. within the 12-mile limit. a violationof our territorial sovereignty. aerial recon detected a burstof very low-frequency transmission. they're fairly certainthey were attempting to communicatewith their command vessel. since then, nothing. no distress signal, no response toour radio transmissions or hydrophone. ostrov still isn't picking up his phone.what's his game, bess? trying to back us out of latviai thought. but to be honest, at this moment, sir,i don't know. is there an optic cableburied along that coast? land-linked to our anti-missiletracking stations up north. so, it could be a spy missiontrying to tap that cable. yes, and it hassix nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying juno55 miles down that channel! it could be awaiting orders! if they wanted to nuke us,they have icbms that could obliterate new yorkin 20 minutes. why park a sub off of alaska? juno would be gone in 30 seconds. and then the sub would disappeardown the coast to seattle, la. how longbefore we can physically engage? you mean threaten it, sir?capture it and report it? i mean destroy it. sir, our closest surface vesselis the navy minesweeper kirkland. it can be at the site within 90 minutes. tell the russians they have two hours. two hours for that sub to be goneor we take it out ourselves, by whatever means necessary. which the russianswill view as an act of war. and this isn't? can't say we didn't warn them. sorry i'm late. so, we're gonna pay tribute tomr helsinger just like nothing's wrong. yes, ma'am. is anything wrong? uh, nothing we're talking about. ma'am, your speechdoesn't need to be formal. just a few unrehearsed,off-the-cuff remarks. and here they are. great. six decades of service in germany,eastern europe and the middle east, a crewman for a vanderbilt yacht and a writer for timeand the paris review. ezra, you truly are a witness to and a creator ofwhat your first boss, henry luce, called \\\"the american century.\\\" thank you. enjoy your life. and have some cake! yeah, sure, sure. oh, please, don't get up, ezra. i'm very sorry.i was supposed to bring you your gift. but we're a little disorganized today. there's no need to apologize, ma'am.the threat of war with the russians? that's apt to frazzle a person. and on the very daythat the last of the cold warriors shuffles off to buffalo too.how's that for irony? has someone been telling you things? i have seen this movie before,madam secretary. the russian navy holding war gamesin the bering sea. i... i happened to see a little itemon the dod daily rundown this morning. we are sending a naval flagshipinto the black sea. ostrov is posturing on russian tv. and with your husband, no less. he's a handsome fella, by the way. you've cleared your calendar. except for those eventswhere your absence would be noticed. you really do knowhow to read the signs. now, tell that to the dmv.they took my damn license! you still work for me, for the nextseveral hours anyway, right? um... yeah. till five o'clock. so, there's this invisible submarine,a super weapon, it's just sitting there,letting us look at it. right! i was wondering about that too. i mean, why turn offthe stealth technology? well, back in my day, we only tried to readthe russians' intentions. their mentality. to look at the chess playeras well as the pieces on the board. well, that's sort of tough since ostrovwon't even admit there's a game. not even talking. but see,that in itself tells us something. i mean, he's a bully and a poser, right? well, the question iswhy isn't he bragging? throwing this in our face? right... right. why... why not tell the russian public or the whole world, for that matter, that he snuck advanced technology inright under our noses? beat us at our own game. in our backyard. and you're right. you know,it isn't like ostrov to hold back. unless there's somethinghe didn't count on. - something went wrong.- hm-hmm. that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. and again... ostrovwould never admit that, would he? makes you wish it was him sitting herenow instead of me, doesn't it, so you could ask him? you do knowthere's no smoking in here? hm-hmm. oh, yeah, yeah. an ordinance against smokingin this building since 1997, i think. i miss the war. i, too, have great respectfor st nicholas. stop filming.what are you doing here, henry? your tour of the church is over. i mean, st george is great.the warrior saint. the victor. but st nick represents compassion. he's the one you turn towhen times are tough. of course,we've trivialized him in the west, made him into the precursorof our modern-day santa claus. what is your point? thought that maybewe would light a candle together. i don't think so. i'm in no need of miracles.you may be. not me. so, we clear? no more pictures.nothing personal. - no posting where others can see.- and? absolutely nothing involvingthe first family or the white house. - thank you.- ok, then, leave it to me. i'll see what i can do to keep majornews outlets from picking up the story. - without telling mom?- yeah, no. it'll all be fine.besides, the best defense is the truth. and since you and harrisonaren't actually an item... you'd tell me if you were, right?honestly, he is kind of cute. - i mean, i'd understand.- no, i have a boyfriend, ok? - oh, yeah? who's that?- it's just this guy that i work with. another internfrom the microloan program? - uh...- wait, what's with the face? are you, like, dating your bossor something? oh, my god.wait, are you dating arthur gilroy? - yeah. look, i know it sounds...- stevie, no. forget harrison.now we have a problem. mom and dad are fine with it. sort of. they may be fine as parents,but from a press perspective, looking at damage control? there are three wordsthat can never go together in this town, and that is \\\"boss,\\\" \\\"intern\\\" and \\\"sex.\\\" - you've gotta end it. now.- what? why? what do you think will happen whenit comes out about you two? and it will. i will deal with it. the microloan programwas on the chopping block. people would loveto get back at your mother. they'd happily throw arthur gilroyonto the fire to do that. you really thinkthat's what will happen? i know it will. this is st nicholas we're talking about?as in kris kringle? he means something morein orthodox tradition. he's the one you turn toin cases of calamity, when things have turned against you. just an observation,but he seemed like a different person. like he was afraid, even. - afraid of what?- i don't know. but i know when true believersare really praying, and ostrov was. the guy that took me huntingthis afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way. could something have happenedto change that? as a matter of fact, something did. henry, i gotta take thisto the president. if ostrov is scared, it may bebecause he's lost control of that sub. you think he could overreact? that or we will. - at this point, it's academic.- wait. the deadline isn't up yet! i'm overriding it.we've got the russians' response. two battle cruisersand three sister attack subs are on a direct course to glacier bay. carrier strike group is on its way to intercept. the sub hasn't budged. the kirkland's stationed over it, aboutto commence dropping depth charges. why? standard naval etiquette. you don't surrender,we force you to surface. the kirkland.we are directly above the target. we are about to drop depth charges. three, two, one. standing by.something's happening. fish in the water.target has launched a torpedo. initiating countermeasures. we are hit.repeat, the kirkland has been hit. sir, we've lost communicationwith the kirkland. carrier strike group has re-establishedcontact with the kirkland. - damage assessment?- injuries. so far, no fatalities. a visual from a medi-chopper.ship is under power, headed for port. norad reports a squadron of russianmig-35s just performed a flyover. - saw the kirkland take the hit.- damn it! i've got northcom and thecommander of the us pacific fleet requesting immediate authorityto engage. a communiqu\\u00e3\\u00a9 from the russians.their vessel was defending itself. any further attack will be met withquote \\\"overwhelming retaliatory force.\\\" without getting into specifics. call their bluff, sir.they're guilty of an act of war. all due respect,we don't know who's guilty of what. i'm just saying, mr president,before we declare war, let's determine exactlywho we're going to war with. what if that sub hasn't movedbecause it's incapable of moving? what if something went wrong? that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. the captain and crewcould be operating without orders, off the chain of command of the kremlinand his president. what does it matter?we respond to actions, not intentions. we do not let an attackon american lives go unanswered. and we don't go to war over a mistake! outside. ostrov lost control of the yaltabecause your husband knows religion and he saw ostrov ask santa for a wish? the secretary's husband has shownhe can be a pretty effective operative, as well as a religious scholar. well, what if i trust your analysis? say ostrov is scared, operatingin the blind, like we all are here. - then what?- we don't push him to the brink. not until we know more. every second we waitlets those battleships get closer or lets the sub fire another missileor six of them, all of them nukes. if we hit it with one of ours,it's got a 10k reactor on board. we risk sending a radioactive tsunamidown the channel... that'll make fukushima a fond memory.i get it, bess. so, what do you propose? we have to take one last chanceand try and talk to that submarine. directly and without moscow knowing. there has to be a way. that's the unmanned submersible.if the russian crew gets a visual, they'll know it's harmless,incapable of attack. we're tapping on their hull. we're using the retractable armto tap out a message. - morse code.- old school, but it works. we're asking them to statetheir name, mission, allow us on board. that's them answering. there's activity. one of her torpedo tubesis opening, flooding. she's gonna fire. no. it's her distress buoy. they're asking for help. stephanie! are you and harrison dalton dating?is he a good kisser? stephanie, is it true?are you and harrison dalton dating? hey, you ok? yeah, i'm not used to being ambushed. yeah, you've had a lot of pings. you're gettingsome serious unwanted attention. yeah, they were outside my house.and then on the street. it's crazy. don't worry. you and harrison are justfilling bandwidth between kardashians. it's gonna blow over soon.none of this matters. listen to me, what matters is our work. right? the microloans program,that's what matters. yeah, about that... hey, you're not quitting, are you? oh, you're quitting this. us. both. i'm quitting... i'm quitting both. look, once they figure outthat i'm not dating harrison, they're going to figure outwho i am dating. so what? you really wanna throw awayyour whole career on some intern? i know i've harped on this a lot,but i have been around, ok? just let me... let me worry about that. look, ok, you know what?you're too old. you're too old and it's not gonna work. is that what you need to hear? uh, ok. ok. it's been really nice working with you. listen to me, do you really wanna losewhat means so much to you? please, just take a few daysand think about the job, not me. the job. ok. i have to go. see you around, kid. see you around, old man. he's the executive officerof the russian submarine, the yalta. they're transmitting from the bridge. they have an antennaattached to their distress buoy. they suffered a malfunctionwhen the new technology failed. there was a fire in the control room.they couldn't contain it. a loss of oxygen. 42 crew members have already died. that's two-thirds of their crew. the captain broke radio silenceto report it. we received instructions. do not signal for help. do not allow the americans to board. if you can't restore power,then destroy the sub and all evidenceof new deflector technology. anything to keep usfrom getting our hands on it. ask why they fired the torpedo. the captain panicked. he thought they were being attacked. the captain's no longer in commandof the vessel. nice way of saying they mutinied. we only have two hours of oxygen left.we're asking for your help. please help us. please... help us. the russian battle cruiserhas reached our line of quarantine. we tell the russians we're gettingthose men out, they'll refuse. they're close enoughto send out a missile and destroy it themselvesbefore we touch it. so, no good options. ostrov will never admit failure or concedethat one of his crews mutinied. not in public. there may be a way to resolve this. a deal that even he can live with. butwe need to go through back channels. and we happen to have one. we do. it's an interesting offer. president dalton will confirm it's real.you can call him directly. i'm sure it's genuine,but i wonder if there are alternatives. the alternative is a returnto the days of the cold war, sir. there was a time whenour two countries, our two grandfathers, fought on the same side. mine survived a siege too. bastogne. the battle of the bulge. at the end of the war, he exchanged cigaretteswith russian soldiers on the elbe river. traveling here, i thought of him.he would've been happy. he knew first-handwhat our countries could accomplish when they work togetherfor the common good. i wear this in honor of mine. - st nicholas.- my grandfather's name saint. nikolai is an old family name. he, too, may have been happyto see us here in peace. perhaps this iswhat he sacrificed so much for. i will call your president. the fire occurred on the yaltaafter an accidental nighttime collision between the russiannuclear-powered submarine and the us minesweeper kirkland. the disabled sub then driftedinto american territorial waters where us naval personnel boarded itin an attempted rescue. tragically, they found no survivors. - crew members will be buried at sea.- poor guys. what a way to go. i'm just glad that thingsdidn't escalate with russia. - look who i brought.- mr helsinger. - we thought you'd left.- your tour of duty ended yesterday. well, i figured one more daywouldn't matter. also, they told mei still had to pick up my gift. oh, yes, the secretarywanted to give that to you personally. it'll just be a few more minutes. i'll wait. getting used to that, waiting. oh, yeah. interestinghow all that turned out, isn't it? - very sad story.- uh-huh. but defense is handling it.we had nothing to do with it. still, it is very interesting. and it is a story. kind of makes you wonderwhat really happened. hmm. these are all of them? all 20 survivors of the yalta.a few hours ago. being given a top-secretand strictly classified welcome aboard the uss teddy roosevelt. the russians will be announcing thattheir remains have been buried at sea. so we'll leave it to themto make sure the story holds up. as you said,they are good at refuting reality. - ostrov accepted the deal?- yes, sir. they'll all get new lives andidentities, here in the united states. the price for letting us rescue them.unbelievable. in all fairness, sir, we did geta chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealthtechnology before giving it back. at least those poor bastardswon't get sent home and shot for mutiny. but they will never seetheir families again. not even to let them knowthat they're alive. any contactputs their loved ones in danger. all so that ostrovcould save face. hell of a thing. sir, the nato forcesare still deploying to latvia and the yalta situationdidn't spiral out of control. - we won this round.- yeah. the world did not blow up on our watch. for at least another day or two. probably my first day on the job. i could not believei was meeting the old man. - whoa. is that john foster dulles?- yeah. the architect of permanent peacein europe. stood up to soviet aggression. that picture was taken the day presidenteisenhower and secretary dulles signed the treatybringing germany into nato. he always said that,\\\"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the...\\\" \\\"the necessary art.\\\" would you guys give us a minute? - congratulations, sir.- thank you. - a pleasure.- mine. i never even asked youwhere you were going. oh, um... prague. budapest, berlin. you ever thinkyou'd live to see the day when the wall came down,open borders, free elections? sometimes we wondered if we'd liveto see the next five minutes. but somehow we understoodthat if we just kept talking... in the end, the sovietsdidn't want to push that button any more than we did. there was a... a rationality to it,crazy as it seems. mutually assured destruction. yeah, but your new enemies today,they have no such qualms. they wanna push that buttonand there's no holding them back. that's a bit grim, isn't it? i don't know. makes me feel naive for being hopeful. oh, you'll be fine. i've seen a lot of them come and go. i think you're the one for the job. - ezra.- madam secretary. you and i should keep talking. well, for what it's worth,ali feels terrible about \\\"starrison.\\\" i know she does. it's ok. and i'm sorry about \\\"starthur.\\\" let's not go crazy with the names. i think that you did a very adult thing. but i know it was hardand i'm so sorry that you're hurting. - come here.- thanks. - sweetie.- well, at least dad will be overjoyed. but he'll hide it well,which is all you can ask for. hm-hmm. this is nice, by the way. you going to an event tonight? i am. the mccord family dinner.soon as dad gets back. oh. yeah, i don't... i don't knowif i'm up for that. well, get up for it. we're celebrating. - why?- because we can. because we're here. dad's home! come on! get your coats. we founda place with awesome vegan options. - i did.- that's nice. listen, i just want you to knowthat even when it's hard and no matterhow much it hurts right now, it is not the end of the world, ok? where are they? here they are. i missed you guys. what do you think? - oh, i think it's awful.- hi. hi. oh, mom texted me. i'm so sorry, honey. - nice try, dad.- i mean it, honey. - hey...- come on. let's get some food, please. - let's go, guys.- wait. let me just get my coat. - dad, can i wear the hat?- no. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from  \",\n          \"\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bf \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:   previously on reign: lord castleroy. i know i'm notthe man of your dreams. will you accept my humble proposal?

be proud of your sons. i am. forward! no. no... watch out! don't hit lola! i'm fine.i'm not that far along yet. it wasn't so long ago we were alltalking about our first kisses? - now you're all married.- and soon you will be as well. unless i ruin it before then. or my father does. he's arriving today,and i'm worried he'll offend lord castleroywith too small a dowry. we can't afford much. have you told lord castleroyyour family's lost its fortune? he might be understanding. tell a suitor we're broke?my father would have a heart attack. i've had more opportunitiesthan you can count. and what do i do? fall in love with a servantand nearly ruin his life, too. we've all had the same opportunity,and look at us. i never dreamt that i'd be wed toa bastard with an imaginary title. lola's been forced to hide herpregnancy. even mary and francis... yes, when we couldn't cometo terms on my brother, my beloved husbandlocked me in a tower. it's been almost a month. are you and francison any better terms? well, i can now talkto him without screaming. does that count as \\\"better\\\"? your majesty?i have dire news from scotland. it's about your mother,marie de guise. the protestants and theirlords of the congregation have sent an army to besiegemy mother in edinburgh. there are men outside thecastle demanding her surrender. her friends don't know how muchlonger she can hold out for. mary, i'm so sorry. my brother james warnedus that the protestants were planning a rebellionagainst my mother. if i had gone with him,i could have stopped it. or you could've been killed. this news only proves it. it's too badwe couldn't protect my mother by locking her in thetower as you did with me. instead of arguing,let's help her. your mother needs soldiersand quickly. and how are we supposed to get them?certainly not from your father. armies can be bought. who has that kind of money? my mother. francis, i've already askedyour mother. more than once. - she's always said no.- then we will ask her together. and we will keep askinguntil she says yes. mother, we need to talk. i realize that.why do you think i sent for you two? oh, you sent for us?so you've heard the news then? i'm sorry, mary.you must be crushed. well, i'm worried, i'm not crushed. there's still timeto send reinforcements. oh, dear. i don't think we'retalking about the same news. have you not heardabout the succession? whose succession? not yours, i'm afraid. word came from england.it's official. elizabeth will be their next queen. - mary tudor's dead?- no! the old bitch is stillclinging to her miserable life. but she managed to cough up the gallto hand over her crown to elizabeth. a bastard, a protestant no less,and not my son's wife! are you even pregnant yet? could you possibly beany less use to france? do not talk to my wife that way.she's a queen and an ally. she was supposed to get me england! we've been feedingand housing this ally for most of her pointless life.and what have we gotten? a drain on our treasure and army, an endless paradeof dramas and headaches. scotland protects france by engagingthe english on two fronts so it cannot focus its forceon growing its foothold on your backyard, calais. i don't need a lecturefrom you on geography. scotland cannot bluntthe english threat alone, your grace. - especially not now!- yes, i've heard all about it. protestants threatening your mother.she needs reinforcements - just like always.- no, not just like always. she is under siege.there are soldiers at her gates! and now you're afraidyour poor mother might die? well, don't we owe itto scotland and france, as rulers, to ask if thatmight be a good thing? your mother can't handlethe job that you gave her. or else she wouldn't be under siege! father, stop this. mary's crown is at stake,which puts france at risk as well. more than her crown is at stake. your mother failed us completely. and now they wanther head on a pike. be careful. or yours might follow. no one? not one country or lord offers help? my mother is a catholic ally. she is under attack. enemies screaming for her head,and no one cares? scotland has many friends at court. but every conversation i have with anoble or diplomat ends the same way. \\\"we're with you, dauphin,but what does the king say?\\\" i hope you didn't tell them. mary, i should neverhave let my father... words don't bother me. you are safe in this castle. - not even my mother...- threats don't bother me, either. losing bothers me. - mary, that's silly, you're...- a queen? yes, i am. but one with scant power here. and less every day back home. on the other hand, i'm also queenbecause i'm a de guise. i have very powerful uncles. i hope you're not thinking... my mother is surroundedon all sides. protestants are burningand pillaging catholic churches. why would they stop theircampaign of destruction before making sure i losemy mother and my crown? but the duke of guise? ever since you've been back at court, you've chosento keep your distance from him. the same as my parents have. your uncle is a dangerouslyambitious man, who has built himself an army bystealing recruits from their mothers. and paying them well. do you know anyone elsewith an army as large or as loyal? loyal to him. and him only. is that someone that you can trust? he is my uncle. if that doesn't buy mehis loyalty, well... trust is a luxuryi can no longer afford. sorry, you're not to be letin under any circumstances. do you know who i am? you're the contest winnerthe king enjoyed. and then cast aside. penelope, what are you doing here? surely a bounty of demeaning tasksawaits you in the kitchen. - i need to see the king immediately.- hmm. i'm pregnant. with his child. you're not pregnant. even if you are,it's not with the king's child. well, the king will want to know. he's going to wonder if he's gotanother chance at happiness. another chance at a childhe could truly love! shut her up now. henry, i love you and i miss you!and i'm carrying your child! you're pregnant? you're certain it's my child? there's been no one else,your majesty. - i was a maiden when you took me.- oh, that's nonsense. see that she's taken care of. set her up with a cottagein one of the villages. oh! i have some mistresses. in bernay, i think. the child could havesiblings to play with, huh? wait. that's all i get? henry! it's more than you deserve. are you sure you wantto be playing this game? if you overplay it, if he losespatience with your displays, you won't like how it ends. the two dead girls before you didn't. nothing bothers me more than problemsi've already solved coming back to be problems again. if that's what you makeof yourself, my child, expect me to make youa lesson to my other problems by grinding you into the dustyou no longer see fit to sweep. oh-oh-oh!oh, i've missed you two so much! father. where's mother? she's at homewith your other sisters. i've only brought these twoso you could introduce them to potential suitors. aren't they a little youngto be looking for husbands? considering all thetrouble we've had with you, i regret not bringing them sooner. and i hope you haven't made toolarge a mess for me to clean up. i realize i made a mistake, but it'snot as bad as you may have heard. no? tell me, will there be any surprises for lord castleroyon your wedding night? anything he can accuse you of later? no, it didn't go that far. does that embarrass you? then imagine howit embarrassed the family. i may sound harsh,but it's for your own good. you can't affordto lose another suitor. do i have it wrong? no, father. i stopped by our new houseon the way back. it needs workbefore we can live there. especially if we want tobring it to your standards. bash, that's lovely,but what happened out there? you've been outin those woods for weeks hunting that creature.have you found it yet? the darkness? no sign of it yet,but it's only a matter of time. the blood wood is vast,but not limitless. have you been all right? i hope there haven't beenany more encounters with the king. i've been staying out of his way. waiting for you to return. why do you stop? it's not our first kiss.you're my husband, it's all right. it's not as though i'm inexperienced. i'm well aware of that. well, if you wanted a virgin... no, i don't.but i care about your experience. i know not all of it has been good. there's no changing that now. i disagree. what are you doing? helping you forget everythingand everyone that's come before this. tell me what you want... very specifically.leave nothing out. all right. do you have any ideawhat you've done? francis, you should havetalked her out of this madness. you should have helped her. i know you're a student of history. perhaps you missed this chapter: the duke was dismissedfrom your father's court for grasping at too much power. and you know what he did then? he fielded that armyto grasp at more. he's a vicious self-serving killer,a threat to any throne. coming from you,that's a ringing endorsement. i wouldn't be so smug, my dear. you just let the devil into our home. thank you so much for coming, uncle. we wish it was underbetter circumstances. like your wedding, perhaps? i seem to have missed my invitationto that happy event, your grace. the wedding was very rushed.i hope you took no offense. nonsense. don't troubleyourself over niceties. i don't. dauphin. the king and queensend their regards. they regretnot greeting you personally, but urgent mattersdemand their attention. you don't have to make excuses. i'm aware of your parents'opinion of me. and from what i hear,even when your father is present, the king is no longer in the castle. i don't know what rumorsyou've heard, sir, but... call me christian,and let's spare ourselves lots of pointless formalityand posturing. i have friends who tell mewhat goes on in this castle. i know why you asked for me, and i'm here toget you out of the hole my sister's incompetence put you in. very well, no posturing. my mother is in danger,but i'm guessing that it will take more thanfamily loyalty to buy your help. so what will it be? money? land? neither. your father dismissedme from court years ago. i want a position in court again. a more permanent one. lord magistrate of france will do. the lord magistrateis the king's right hand. you want a better position thanthe one that you were stripped of after you challenged your king? i didn't challenge my king,i served him. by appointing generalswithout his permission and doling out political patronageto your friends? while your father was busy producingheirs, bastards and otherwise, he needed my help,whether he cared to admit it or not. he needed your loyalty, whetheryou cared to provide it or not. i can make your army serveme for nothing if i wanted. i have that authority. they're right outsideif you'd like to try. i just don't know how many will stillbe around tomorrow if i'm not. they're loyalto the man who pays them, not the boy who waves crowns at them. we'll consider the termsand present them to henry. uncle. your father will never agree. he has to. or you'll lose scotland,and so will we. hurry up!i mean, i want you and everything, but we must be quick. what's the meaning of this? sorry, your majesty, i was just... i know what you were just,you vile little man. have you no decency? laying your handson a favorite of your king? leave, before i have youthrown in the dungeon! i hope he didn't hurt you. - no.- i got here just in time, didn't i? if that man had had his way, he'd be able to claimyour unborn child, and where would thatleave you with the king? i'm already pregnant.my child is the king's. then i'm sure you'll agreeit's not just yourself that you need to protect anymore. the life of the king'sunborn baby is at stake. we simply can't risk that. you need to go somewhere safe. the king will be outragedwhen he finds out you're locking meand his baby in here. no, the king will be outragedwhen \\\"his\\\" baby comes out looking more likeone of his stable boys. or, more likely,no baby comes out at all. neither of those things will happen. enjoy your solitude, my dear. i'll drop by every month or so to share in the joy ofwatching your belly grow. wait! don't leave me here! a word of advicefrom someone who knows: don't make friends with the rats.they bite. wait, wait. greer tells me her sisters havenever been to a castle before. i say we give them the royal tour. that can wait. i'd like to discuss the matterof greer's dowry as soon as possible. now? in front of your daughters? we don't need to discussgreer's dowry. i've given the matter some thought,and i'm not interested. not interested? then what is it you want? only your blessing for her hand. you have it, my lord. i can't tell you how happythat makes me. i need to speakwith you, father. it's urgent. - nothing is more urgent than war.- i agree. that's why i came to discussa solution for scotland. all this time we've been waitingfor mary tudor to give us england. to allow us the privilegeof putting your wife on the throne. but the english don't wait. they take what they want,just like they took calais from us. so i'm going to take it back. after that,i'll take all of england. we'll attack from scotlandin the north and calais in the south. when they wake up tomorrowto see french soldiers massing around calais,we might even get lucky. they might surrender to sparethemselves certain defeat. tomorrow? how could you...? i can't wait to see thelook on mary tudor's face when i claimthe english throne for myself. i just hope that sick cow liveslong enough for me to execute her. father, tomorrow? - what have you done?- can't you read? general brantome's men are movingnortheast from rouen as we speak. general brantome? i had to relieve laval.no imagination. no courage. stop babbling, father,and tell me the truth. - did you do this?- why wouldn't i? we don't have the strengthto take calais. our armies are spread too thin,all over europe! if we lose,and they capture our forces, they can stage an invasion andsweep down through france unopposed! but francis, we can't lose! yes, we can, and we will! father, thousands will die. you don't understand. \\\"blessed be the lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.\\\" i prayed for his guidance, and he spoke to mein a glorious waking dream. he said that i wouldclaim victory at calais! son, be happy with me! thanks to your father,you are going to rule half of europe! francis? what's the matter?you look like you've seen a ghost. i have.it's father, he's gone utterly mad. define \\\"utterly,\\\"because this is a man who's ridden a pigthrough the throne room in nothing but his under things. mother, he is starting a war. - what?- he's attacking calais. oh, francis. your father,is that what he told you? - it's all over his maps.- darling, relax. i've taken general lavalinto my confidence. he knows to do nothingwithout my approval. general laval has been dismissed. brantome's in charge now. who's brantome? oh, yes, i forgot. he's the new one henry brought in to replace laval when herefused to rename the fifth army \\\"god's gauls.\\\" don't worry, brantome's with us. all of these dismissed generals. i'm beginning to guesshow mary's uncle knows so much. what will you do when father realizesyour contravening all his orders? tomorrow he'll beinvading the spanish. the next day the dutch. when he starts rememberingwho he invaded yesterday, perhaps his wits will have returned, and this whole nightmarewill be over. darling, relax. if i left things to chance, we'd still be bowingto queen penelope. i promise, it's under control. for france's sake,i hope you're right. no. not yet. you know, we can stop all this. it worked.i've forgotten all about... you see, i can't even rememberwhat his name is anymore. good. there's still morethat i want you to forget. oh, in that case, i'll forget thatyou told me not to take off my skirt. that's not what i mean. i want you to forget... every boy who ever smiled at you. every man who ever flirted with you. everyone but me. were the guards necessary? surely a messengerwould have sufficed. i wanted to speak to you alone,away from your men. but not away from your men, i see. have you spoken with your father? the king will not agreeto the position you want. you never asked him, did you? we both know it was a fool's errand. there is something elsethat you want from me. are you going to tell me,or am i meant to guess? wise men look to the future. they're patient. when i started to buildmy army a decade ago, other men saw a ragtag rabble. i saw what it would become: a bargaining chipthat would one day bring kings to me, begging for favors. you never expected to befather's lord magistrate. you want to be mine, when i'm king,even if you have to be patient. i won't have to be patient for long,i don't think. is it poison, i wonder,that is driving him mad? i don't trust youand i don't like you. well, being liked is a king's job,not his lieutenant's. everything in me saysi should say no. and yet you are here...away from your wife. i think you knewyou might have to say yes, and she would object. she would pay any priceto save scotland, but would never ask you to. she knows how your familyfeels about me. well, you've just explainedto me why i love her. enough to have her lockedin a tower, i've heard. do you want this positionor don't you? i want the chanceto serve a great ruler. great rulers aren't afraid ofthe truth, no matter how painful. the truth is, you love your wife. the truth is, she needs me. so what will it be... my prince? when i am king,the position is yours. but i have one condition. your men will report to meas they would to you. - but why would you need my men to...- i'm going with you to scotland. well, that's unwise. and if you die,your promise to me is worth nothing. well, then,i suggest you keep me alive. are you serious? my uncle agreed? he'll send enough men to scotlandto quell the rebellion and save my mother? yes. i'd almost lost all hope. francis, how did you manage it? i convinced the dukethat it was in his best interests. - i'll explain when i'm back.- back? back from where? i am going with him to scotland. what? francis, no. mary, i have to. it's the only way that i canassure your mother's safety. and what of your safety? well, the duke getsnothing if i don't survive. with a man like that,i can't imagine a better guarantee. francis, i don't know what to say. you're saving my country,my mother, and you're risking your lifein the bargain. you needn't say anything. i've only kept my promise. as a king and a husband. you've done so much more than that. i'm not complaining, but... i thought you wantedto take things slowly. not anymore. i'm here now. out with it. there was never a baby. that took less time than i thought. please can i keep workinghere in the castle? i'll empty chamber pots,i'll muck stalls, anything. oh, stop groveling. as much as it warms me to hear it. i may have other uses for you. - other uses?- i have ladies, technically, they're my friends,none of whom i trust. because they're womenwho sleep with men for a cause. much like you did with the king. only it would be my cause. i promise you'll enjoy it morethan emptying chamber pots. i'm gonna send you toa lady i know in italy. you'll be taught proper manners,and the art of deception. and if you work hard, you may bewelcomed back in the castle as a member of my flying squad. this is where you thank me. thank you, your majesty. uh... that will need fixing, too. my family has owned successfulmines for generations, and i'd always hoped topass that expertise on to my son, but unfortunately,i've had only daughters. take the dumfries mine, it's returned 20 tonsof copper a week for years. a perfect investmentfor a man such as yourself. lord castleroy does quite wellin the spice industry, father. why would he want to invest in minesall the way over in scotland? you can't want me towaste lord castleroy's time explaining things that arebeyond your intelligence. do i have it wrong? i think you do, sir.quite wrong. i think you forget you're no longersimply addressing your daughter, but my future wife. and i'm sorry to say that'snot your first mistake. i've done research on your mines,and dumfries... has been played out for years. much like the rest of your holdings. now, let's look atsome different figures. as part of our marriage settlement,i will provide 10,000 francs to each of greer's sistersto be used as their future dowries. this will allow your daughtersto marry men of title and fortune, making you and your family wealthy. that is what you want, isn't it? uh... there is just one condition. greer will have final approvalover her sisters' marriages, so she can see to it thatthey marry men they love, not those forced on them. why are you doing this? a good businessman always knowswhat something is worth. and to me, greer is priceless. i never meant for youto go to war for me. when are you goingto realize that i love you, and i'll do anything for you? darling, let me be gratefulfor what you've done without making promisesyou can't keep. what you did was extraordinary. i think maybe when i return, you won't be the only onewaiting for me. you're suddenlyvery sure of yourself. i am. but just to be safe. look at me. am i the only one in this bedwith something to forget? what do you mean? when you're with me, i want to be the only oneinside your head. i want you to look into my eyesand see only me. i want you to alwaysremember what i feel like. so when you're using yourfingers for some other task, you wish they weretouching me instead. i will. i want you to always remember whatit feels like to be with your wife. ah, my wife and my son. closest family i have in this world. sharing my castle,my blood, my legacy. why would you lie to me? what do you mean? don't bother addingmore lies to the pile. i know what you've done.you've kept me caged up in this place like one of your song birds. sending in generals to humor me. don't blame mother when you've been hatching plans to attackhalf of europe. they aren't plans anymore! french forces marchedfor calais this morning. they're already halfway there. you think i'm delusional? read these dispatches. they aren't from anyof your performing generals. what happened to general brantome? i've sacked them all.we don't need any generals. not when we have a kingto lead our men. i leave tonight to join the invasion. oh, dear. no trousers. this keeps happening. i realize now that you twowere only trying to protect me. guarding my legacy. but that's my job, not yours. i will not be rememberedas king henry, ruler who dreamed of conquest. i'll be remembered asking henry, conqueror. greatest military strategistsince hannibal. henry, darling, you're not well. i have headaches!you know what else i have? the backing of god. francis, please,talk some sense into your father. it's too late.we can't stop the invasion. and anyway, father's right. what? we can take calais. any fool knows he can't do that. it's true, father's armywould fail on its own. but two armies. one marching head on. the other across this frozen marsh, flanking the english from behind. do you mean the duke's army?mary's army? mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that? my son, making history with me, just like i've always dreamed. i wanted to apologizefor my behavior earlier. i hope i wasn't out of line. it's my father who should beapologizing, though he never would. no one's ever stood up for me likethat before. or for my sisters. i was surprised to see how quietyou acted around your father. i've come to ratherenjoy your usual nature. outspoken, bold. how long have you knownthe truth about us? i've known for some time. as a businessman,i always do my research. but as a gentleman,i wasn't about to bring it up. and as your future husband,you should know i'm... too rich to care. i can't thank you enough. no need to thank me. everyone deserves a chanceto find happiness. just as i have. which brings me to this, i havesomething i'd like you to look over. but promise me you won't sign ituntil you're ready. this is our wedding contract. yes, and since you're now in charge of all marriagecontracts for your family, it means nothingwithout your approval. is something wrong? no, that felt surprisingly right. so you are takingmy mother's last hope, leaving her to the mercy ofthousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown. mary, please understand. i do understand. you're doing what you thinkis best for your country. not only my country. if france is beaten at calais,your country will suffer, too. - france can hardly defend scotland.- defend scotland? when have you ever defended scotland? except with brave words? - that is not fair.- now you want fair? we are rulers, not schoolchildren. blood will be spilled becauseof the choice you have made, - my mother's blood.- you don't know that. but the blood of thousandswould be spilled... - yes, french blood, i know.- i do not only think of france! no, you do not. but you do put her first. as any king would. then can you forgive me? it is myself i cannot forgive. i've made an awful mistake. our marriage was an awful mistake. please don't say that. there were a thousand momentswhere i could've done something. made secret treaties, sold favors, even snuck away to scotlandto be with those people who need me. and do you know why i didn't? because i love you. because i am your wife. mary, listen,when we have taken calais, the first thing i will dois travel to scotland with your uncle's army. we can still save your mother. like when you promised you wouldtake me to scotland with my brother? like when you promised soldiersthe time before that and the time before that? you make it sound like every promisei make is an empty one. what other promise can you make? you are the future king. it's not that simple. maybe it should be. for both of us. what does that mean? nothing. i don't know. i'm only going to asktwo things of you. the first is that youstop making me promises you know in your heartyou can't keep. and the other? come back to me. live through this battle. and don't let england cost me you. forward! have faith, mary.francis is clever and strong. he'll return home safely. i hope so. but even if he survives, our marriage is... what? francis is tryingto save his country, and i can forgive him for that, as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needsto be done for scotland, whatever that may be. what if he can't forgive you? well, that will just be too bad. i won't let him putmy country at risk again. watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[' enjoy all vod in high quality @ 4kvod.tvget live tv,movies,shows in one package gang vs. g-men planning: shigeru okada, tsune yabescreenplay: sakae sajima photography: yoshikazu yamazawasound: koichi iwata lighting: kenzo ginyaart director: hiromu kitagawa music: koichi kawabeeditor: kan suzukiasst. director: mikio koyama production asst.: eiji takedadeveloping\\u00ef\\u00bc\\\\x9atoei chemical industry starring koji tsuruta tatsuo umemiyashinichi chibayoshiko sakuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku spec', \\\"kuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku special joint investigation meeting hey, here they come! chief! what wasthe meeting about?

- what are you investigating?- is tatsumura involved? there are rumors that sanritsuindustries is behind all this. isn't its president tatsumurathe mastermind behind this incident? aren't you flooded with complaints aboutpolice ineffectiveness in the case? they say the authorities are toocautious, or worse, weak-kneed. i'll ask you the same question:what do you guys think? it's easy to criticize others. but are you trying to bring backthe old, heavy-handed police power? it's not as if cautiousinvestigation is bad. and that's part of thedifficulty of this job. it's not you who's been getting yourmen killed at every turn, it's me. oh, hi. the press? yeah. i got a little excited. i went to the farewell ceremonyfor detective sugiyama. i see. well. that's three in a row. - what a shame.- yeah. and...the meeting? it's like we've hit a dead end. we don't have a concrete plan. all the violent incidentsin this neighborhood are connected tosanritsu industries. i'm sure i'm onthe right track, but i don't know where to startto catch them by the tail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 we don't have a single clue. we're helpless. it's our own faultthat the city is calling us weak-kneed. the three men who diedwould turn in their graves. sanritsu industriesbusiness information chairman saichi sakurapresident j\\u00e5\\u00aago tatsumura i just had an idea. i heard a rumor on the street. tatsumura has recently takencomplete control of the organization. they say things are gettingawkward with his uncle, sakura. mmm-hmm... so? if we can crack the organization bysuccessfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get someclues for the investigation. i see. but that would require-- of course.we can't do it alone. we really need the help of a manknowledgeable about the organization. mmm-hmm. a kind of guerrilla operation. interesting idea, but i don't know if there's anybodywho could be that useful. i actually have a littlebit of an idea about that. oh? who is it? tojima brothers hello! hello! coming! oh! old man! hi. hi. welcome. - are you two working together?- no. she wouldn't stop askingme to show her how to fix it. boy, you look terrible! oh! did you have the ceremony yet? no, not yet. it seems rather sillyto call it a wedding now, but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - we'll invite you when we do, mr. ogata.- sure. - please come in.- okay. it looks like two more cars have beenadded after not coming here for a while. but the two drivers are unavailable,so they're just like decorations now. - please have a seat.- okay. hard-working, kind-hearted\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 she'll make a good wife. yeah... i suppose so. so, what broughtyou here today? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 it's kind of hard to saywhat i'm asking you to do. actually, i just wanted to askyou to go back to the old you. - the old me?- yes. a yakuza. old man, don't jokearound with me. i wouldn't joke aboutasking you to do this. please... i really need your help! what's the story? you want me to be a g-man. you're no strangerto tatsumura. i would like to ask you to do this. and let me assure you, this isn't about saving theface of the police or anything. we have to crush that germ-likeorganization as soon as possible. old man, if you want to talk about that,please take it up with someone else. i'm asking because i knowi can count on you. it's not a job thatjust anybody can do. don't give me too much credit. i'm not that respectable. but-- first of all, i don't want to doanything that'll open old wounds. okay. maybe i shouldn't haveasked you to do it. why don't you get outof this business? i'd be happy tohelp you find a job. it would be my pleasure. but i'm a man with no education at all living only for this jobsince i was a simple police officer. the grime sticks anddoesn't seem to come off. i might have to die to get it clean. i'm sorry i can't help you. it's okay. i'll definitelyattend your wedding. yeah. bye. oh? is mr. ogatagoing home already? - yes.- oh. what was that about? it has nothing to do with us. yes, this is tojimatransport co. huh? what's up? it's the usual\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - hello.- how's it going? are you ready toaccept our protection? i refuse. i don't wantto be under your care. think carefully about it. without a driver there wouldn'tbe any business, you know. what? what did he say this time? don't worry about it. huh? the car's back. oof! brother! - osamu!- osamu! what's wrong? he said he gotjumped by thugs. - thugs?- yeah. - let's go inside to treat the wound.- yes. so when did you get out? today. i was on my way here. i was surprised to see that thetruck was marked \\\"tojima transport\\\"! boss, i'm quitting. no matter how many livesi have, it won't be enough. what are you saying? the two guys taking a break musthave gone through the same thing i did. you can't tell usto fight the yakuza. let's do it, bro!i can help you! to be honest, i'm disappointedthat you quit the business. osamu... what have you learnedfrom four years in juvie? i'm not going to fight. i'm going now because they'reprobably waiting for me. you're free to quit. you can take yoursalary up to today. bro! bro! i'm disappointed in you, bro. where's the brotherthat i used to know? i'm sure he wouldn't just sit backand let this happen to him! idiot! damn it! you're not my brother! osamu! don't talk to yourbrother like that. - take care of yourself.- thank you. but, you know, don't youthink it's frustrating? when you'reprovoked like that-- it's frustrating, but we'll be out ofbusiness if we take on every fight. we're not selling fights. but you were the boss's daughter.you should understand how i feel. i've forgotten, you know, the old days. both your brother and i. suit yourself. no wonder my brotherbecame a coward. his wife's too beautifuland too decent. sassy little thing,aren't you? you should look beforeyou say something weird. tojima brothers you see? this business belongsto you and your brother. damn it. my brother, he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 your brother was really lookingforward to you getting out. you have to understand. we're half-brothers. we're not meant to be likeother brothers in the world. what are you talking about? i'll throw you a welcomehome party tonight. what's your favorite thing? what do you want to eat? osamu? osamu!where are you going? who was it? who was it? who did this? - mr. jo.- boss! - this is my car.- what? i parked it on the cornerover there, and it's\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 that's right. why is this happening again? shall i take care of this? mind your own business.leave me alone. don't say that. you need our protection in casethings like this happen. right? - that means you guys are--- boss! anyway, let's go in. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6they've even come toyour business for protection money? if they know the old you, they wouldn'tbe able to do something stupid like that. well, go ahead. sorry. because of my mess,even your store is-- no, actually, my businessis being blackmailed, too. you too, jo? yeah. in the beginningthey called me to invite me. when i refused, the thugs came. i told 'em to look people in the eyewhen talking and threw 'em out. and here we are today. you didn't report itto the police, did you? yeah, i thought about that. but if the cops are there allday long, no customers will come. they predictedthat much, all right. do you know which groupthe thugs belonged to? they belong to the takedafamily down the street. i think sanritsu industries is themastermind behind the protection racket. i heard that thetakeda family's boss became a shareholder ofsanritsu industries the other day. i think that's fishy. i didn't know that. a champion, huh? well, i'm past my prime ifi'm remembering the old days. welcome back! oh... - what happened to your car?- uh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what happened to the drivers? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 did they all quit? yes. but that's okay.hire someone new again. maybe i should learn to drive. what about tomorrow's work? i turned it down earlier. i'm sure it's not a good time. come on! tonight is osamu'swelcome home party. it's going to beat my apartment. - osamu?- what's wrong? i showed those guys from the takedafamily how strong i got in juvie. idiot! what would you do ifsomething happened to you? worry more about yourselfthan you do about me! - osamu, what happened?- ouch! captain fujikawa washappy that you agreed. we'll help as much as we can. but this work is informal. yes. so it's strange when i'm theone asking you to do this, but - you take good care of yourself and--- old man. you needn't worry about that. i'm willing to do it evenif no one asks me to do it. well, i feel better nowthat you put it that way. and what about your subordinates? i want to work in my own way, so i'm going to get five or sixguys who are used to fighting. what i'd really like from youis a car that starts fast. i've already got it for you. i've got a good driver too. - come with me now.- okay. why did we stop here? well, wait and see.he'll appear any moment. huh? matsushima! hey, you're caught red-handed. i haven't done it yet. you should be glad you haven't. if you had, you'd be backeating stinky food in jail. sorry. i'll tell you what, instead, i'mgoing to have a little chat with you. please, no more lectures-- that's not what i meant. - i want to show you something.- huh?

yeah, we've alreadymade the deal. please take it! hey, why are you doing this?what are we going to do now? i'm sorry to break it to you, but i've decided togo back to my old life. what? you'll have to live in theapartment for a while. that's the brother i know! sorry, but there's a world of men thatwomen don't understand. right, bro? you go live with her.and get a job. that's stupid! please, please don't do it. did you forget whathappened four years ago? didn't you almost die tryingto crawl out of the muck? don't get desperate just becausethings aren't working here. we can go somewherewhere there are no yakuza. please, please don't do it. i'm sorry, but i'vemade up my mind. this time i'm goingto do it my way. that's right!that's right, brother! but you can't do it alone, bro.hey, please, let me do it. i'll bring my friendsif you want. idiot! i said no, you can't do it. pack your bags with her. i've now given youthe gist of it. i'd really like somehelp from you all. i just want to assure you thatwe're subcontracting for the police. it's low-pay despite the risk. i'd like to know if you'restill willing to take it on. please don'thesitate to tell me. when you say subcontracting forthe police, how will you start? first i'll pretend to makea comeback to the yakuza. then i'll infiltrate their organizationunder the guise of a turf war. that would meanwe're the tojima family. gentlemen, this is theperfect role for you. if you look in the mirrori think you'll see what i mean. i don't want to flatter you, buti'd hardly call you all good citizens. but it takes a hell of a lot ofguts and horsepower to hit them. you're all perfect teammembers in that regard. hey, bro, even though it's police work,we're putting our lives on the line. there will be a littlereward, won't there? i can't guarantee that. i'm sure you'llmanage it just fine. but don't forget there'sa policeman next to you. so let's hear your answer. can you guys give me a hand? let's show them what we can do! i'll get tatsumura backfor his protection racket. how about you, matsushima? well, i'm being askedto take care of the car. i don't see anyoneelse qualified. goro? i'll do my best tosave the extra money. mr. policeman? it's my duty soi'll do whatever-- you scared me! - osamu!- brother... don't treat me like a stranger! everyone, i'm hisbrother, osamu kaji. we're actually half-siblings. how many timeshave i told you? i'm not gonnamake you one of us. again with that.i wish you'd trust me. but a goofball like youwould be the first to get hit. i can't take careof a guy like that. well, then, brother.you mean you can't-- you'd be slowing me down.give it up. fine, then!i'll do my own thing! osamu... osamu! he's just like you the way he won'tback out of something once he's said it. he's a real pain in the ass. so everything isokay then, right? okay, now let's get to work. first you'll go out and spread wordthat i'm making a comeback. tojima brothers \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by pistol. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by tommy gun. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa by dynamite. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa everybody, everybodydisappears in a puff of smoke \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa with water. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when the blood lefton the bed dries up \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa there, i hear it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa that rhythm \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa sing it! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa dance all you want! \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa jam session on anenchanting night \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa i'm drunk and i'm all alone \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa may i sit here?

huh? you'll have to ask tatsumura if you can hirea guy named tojima. then you're\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 next time you see me,call me tojima. recreation center construction who are you? you almost got yourself killed. do you know what'sgoing on here?

you think you saved me? that doesn't make upfor my brother! wait a minute! i get how you feel, buti've got a job i've got to do. i won't let you stop me. - boss, are you hurt?- i'm fine. the advertisement worked 100%. i've already gota lot of sponsors. that's the guy. him? a debt is a debt. i'll wait untilyour job is done. in exchange, i'm not leavingyour side for a while. i won't let you dieuntil it's by my hand. so you're a bodyguard. well, okay. he's an old friend of mine.try to get along. starting tomorrowwe're going to be busy. sanritsu industries boss, tojima is here. what do you want to do? i thought they'dbe here by now. hey. to what do we owethis surprise? it's been a while. how's your shippingcompany doing? i heard you were happy togetherwith the previous boss's daughter. i don't think i can makea living as an honest man. i'm going backto the old tojima. i see. that's why you came allthe way out here to say hello. shimadzu. let's celebratetojima's comeback. book a welcome home party-- you already threw mea welcome home party. a fancy one with lead bullets. i know it was supposedto be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. tojima.... you've become nastierliving as an honest man. i'm not as bad as you. you took over this buildingin less than four years? i was hoping you'd tell mehow to make money. that's the kind of advice one canonly get from a professional. i wish you'd stopwith the innuendos. sanritsu industriesis a legitimate company. and we pay our taxes. if you want, you cango ask the tax office. but i hear there's a lot of money to bemade without the tax office knowing. what do you mean? for example...protection rackets. that sort of workfits these guys. don't move! what's this? a raccoon dog's tail? i'm the one who built all this. i have some allies,but also many enemies. you can never be too careful. everyone, leave us. i think it's time tocut to the chase. i'm being extorted, it seems. no, i just need a little help. it's a lot of work to make upfor four years of absence. i'd like to borrow your territoryfor a while, for old time's sake. sorry, i don't have anythinglike that right now. i have enough to eat running atheater and a recreation center. oh yeah? that's a relief. then i'll make my ownterritory without reservation. that's all well and good,but be careful. they say once a boxer retires,he never makes a comeback again. jinxes can be brokensomeday, you know. well, look forward to it. i see. tojima has shown up so now tatsumura hasmore things to worry about. that's why he tried toget rid of him last night. that was a screw-up,out of character for tatsumura. i'm getting lucky. it's good to live a long time. you've pit the two against eachother for your own advantage? i'm the one who originally createdsanritsu industries, after all. i didn't want to keep it intatsumura's care forever. so... shall we propose the election of a newpresident at the next general meeting? no, i think we'll waitand see what tojima does. - chairman!- hmm? mr. tojima has cometo say hello to you. good thing he came now. have him come over here. mr. chairman,it's been a while. yeah, a while. i hear youmade a comeback the other day. yeah. i'll needyour help again. yeah, sure. but now i'mpractically retired. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 i heard a rumor that you'll be returningas president of sanritsu once again. there are too manyirresponsible rumors out there. i agree. i was even gossipingwith tatsumura just now. with tatsumura? they sayyou had a dispute last night. that's just anotherirresponsible rumor. but you better be careful. it's weird saying thisto your face, i've always preferred youto tatsumura. if you ever need help,i'm always here for you. oh. i'll see you, then. well, i'll leave youalone for today. this is a fine housefor an old fox's nest. and they're even planningto expand the place. sanritsu industries i see. that old manand tojima, huh? i think we can still dosomething about it now. you're something yourself too. what are you after? the sakura family's territory? well, if that's on the table. okay. i'll grant you that. in exchange, get to work. eliminate the old man. boss. he's your blood relative. i don't remember havingan uncle like that. murakami. take the kijima brothers. mr. chairman. these men say that theycame from tatsumura. what do they want? can't you handle it yourself? no, i definitely can't. what are you doing?stop it, you! chairman of sanritsuindustries murdered killing anyone whogets in the way? but this is too much! this is exactly howtatsumura works. now their organizationis strengthened again. we have to find anew way to get inside. welcome. can iget you a drink? i don't have any money.here, let me pay with this. we're supposed to ask for cash. don't be so uptight. i heard whoserestaurant this is. welcome. eh? are you the onei need to talk to? maybe. we'll see. boy, where are you from? check the family register.no comment. well?! i want a clear answer! come this way. here. the pistol. wait here. manager's office i have someonewe could use. we heard your story. - go home for today.- what? we have to check if the gunhas been used in a crime. if you can't tell by holding it,then you're an amateur. what? that gun isn't loaded. you're not qualifiedto be a bouncer. move! are you the boss? if you really want to workhere, do as you're told. waving that thing aroundwon't get you anywhere. got it? got it. nice to meet you. the takeda family controlsthe bar area here. the bars and cabarets in this areaare the yoshi family's territory. both are backed bysanritsu industries, i'm sure. just as i thought. so what's the connection betweentatsumura and the owners? it doesn't seem to bejust protection rackets. i bet they're into somethingmore profitable than that. okay. this istheir turf, anyway. let's provoke them one by one. tojima's taking over this bar.get lost, goons! motherfucker! get him! what the hell, you guys? the tojima family's takingover this place now. if you want protectionmoney, we refuse! what?! - how did you do?- good. ah. now the takedafamily's stronghold. let's all go together. - what's that?- i got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weirdsymbols in the purchase column. let's check thenext place too. go back and tell your boss. tojima is taking overthis business for a while. it'd be interesting tofind a similar ledger. - let's check around.- yeah. somewhere like in here? this is why amateursare no good. leave these thingsto the professionals. it's just beenhigh school so far. now comes the college class. find anything? nothing of value. it's written thesame way as this. what could this mean? i'm sure it has somethingto do with their organization. six people. just six people and they'reraiding turf all over the place. and what do you want me to do? i'm truly ashamed. actually, i'm going totake care of this right now. i just wantedto let you know. in that case,leave him be. let him do histhing for a while. but that's-- don't you get it? what's a couple ofcabarets and bars? the point is to keep ourorganization unnoticed. wait and see what they uncover. sanritsu industries - hey.- huh? so what are they doing? they're not moving at all.the car's crying. we'll let it rest while it can. what the hell is going on? he's wearing a sanritsu badge! who are you calling? oh, it's you, bro! don't scare me! - i was just about to call you--- come here. what the hell is going on here? i used my brain a little. not many people know thatyou and i are brothers, right? because we havedifferent last names. so i figured it was up to me tosneak into tatsumura's place. i told you that you can't. it's too late. i'm in. so you don't wantto hear what i got? you got something? actually, i'm justabout to get it. idiot. you've got me beat. well then, brother! but be careful, you'retalking with the enemy. if you're as careless as youwere just now, you're dead. they're totally systematic. in that organization, unless you're a real old-timer,you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t figure out anything. it seems so. i tried to step on his incomestreams, but it didn't work so well. i'm sure he's got somebig source of money. i'll find it eventually. see you later, brother. all right, place your bets! but think carefullybefore betting. watch closely! here we go. that one. you choose this one? are you sure this is the one? too bad! i feel bad abouttaking from a cop. okay, one more time! we have a visitor. hey, stop. they've been going to barsand cabarets for a while. they don't seem to becollecting laundry. what are they doing? okay, i'll find out. give me a hand. hey, can i get a light? thanks. hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, what do we do? what do we do? good! it's a red light! you stupid bastard,you had me worried. i see. so the dry cleanerwas a collector. yeah. but where is thatmoney coming from? a bag this big witha bunch of bills in it. and instead of laundry,there's a load of whiskey. a daihatsu midget,whiskey, and wads of cash\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what kind of mystery is this? we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to poke around more. come on. come on. i went to see mr. ogata. i was hoping to askmr. ogata to stop you. and he told me the truth. you should have just told me. am i such an unreliable woman? no. this is my problem. i thought i'd washed my hands of thebusiness, but they don't respect that. i had to do it. to break free. i understand. but this is not just about you. good luck. you're doing a goodthing for the world. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 don't overdo it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i lie in bed, there's a man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i drink wine, there are two men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i walk down the street,there are three men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all stare at me, dead \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa boss, tojima is here. what? okay. i'll check it out. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa the people who loved me \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all disappear \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa little red flowers in the heartare hickeys made of lead bullets \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa what's up? are you stillscouting for recruits? not anymore. i found a really good warrior. i think you're inthe wrong place. is that so? i think i read the signproperly and i came in. i think the womanmade a mistake too. aren't you just a kid?don't smoke. what? i've got a lead.i'm counting on it. punch me once. you son of a bitch! what should we do? what's he up to? - let's go.- hold on. wait a little longer. - check the moonshine.- got it. i'll leave that to you. oh, hello! metropolitan police? listen, i'm at the\\\"night castle\\\" cabaret! there are drunks rampaging! yes! please come! - you're saved by the bell.- it's a draw. something extra. i wonder if it'sjust a turf war. no, it can't be. moonshine. this was the key totheir secret organization. so, through the bosses ofthe amusement quarters they would get this moonshineinto bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profitdividends to the shareholders. then this ledger is likely arecord of moonshine sales. i wonder how much moneythey can make on this. if they put import priceson such cheap liquor, they'll make twentytimes as much. - twenty times?- and it's not taxed. compared to that, protectionrackets are nothing. in any case, we're going to find out wherethe moonshine factory is. then we can havethem by the throat. first, let's do all we canto find the couriers. wait a second. what's that? they're collectingempty bottles. so they finally have ajob that looks like a job. that's kind of weird. - what?- those two cars behind us. they've been followingus for a while now. here they come! hey! that's one gone! hey! here they come again! damn it! that was close. good job. hey, matsushima, what's wrong? oh! stupid son of a bitch! why didn't you tell me sooner? this car was entrusted to me.i can't leave it with anyone. you're stubborn! what's wrong? we got shot at while tailingthe bottle collection truck! call a doctor! if it gets in the papers,they're gonna find out. it's no time fortalk like that! wait. lay him down over there. stay sitting. don't just stand there.run hot water. will it work? it didn't work outfor my brother. because it was closeto his vital organs. but it's going tobe okay this time. come on, bite down! harder! hey! he only fainted. it's done. so their focus is nowon the organization. by the looks of it, they'redoing a lot of research. maybe he's a rat for the cops. no way. no way would thecops trust a yakuza. but this needs athorough investigation. if he's willing to go so far, i have an idea too. i came here today to talk toyou on behalf of tatsumura. so now you're going to joinme and take down tatsumura? tatsumura wants to havea peaceful talk with you. i'm gonna usethis for a moment. hello. hey, it's me. yeah, i'mgiving him the phone now. it's tatsumura. hello. tojiima? it's me. i don't have anything totalk to you about now. you might not, but i do. say, would you like tohear a pretty woman's voice? what? would you liketo say something? she doesn't seem tohave anything to say. but you're not an idiot. so i'm sure you'llback off quietly. don't give in! all you've donewill be for nothing! akiko! don't worry about me! don't back off for a second! akiko! stop! got it now?

heh-heh. well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - sis!- don't move! sorry about last night. i didn't mean tomake things worse. i just thought our discussion mightgo better with a woman involved. well, have a seat. we're not supposed to sitdown and talk to each other. i see. well, let's hear youranswer right away. you'll back off,of course, right? i'm not backing off yet. oh... i guess we had it all wrong. we thought you hada thing for that woman. so you don't carewhat happens to her? i'd like to ask yousomething first. do you have the guts tomake a suicide pact with me? a suicide pact? yeah. you wouldn't have the guts. because you havetoo many things. you ruined my business. and you even kidnapped akiko. thanks to you, i'm reallynaked. i have nothing to lose. not even my life. if anything happens to akiko,you can be sure i'll kill you. if you think being surrounded byguns will stop me, you're wrong. i swear i'll get it done. how about it? shall i try it right now? if you don't have the guts,return akiko immediately. then you can fight me. are you so rotten thatyou can't even do that? boss, i know who the spy is. who is it? it's that bastard kaji. he didn't see me and i caughthim trying to save the girl. i tied him up and threwhim in the basement. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 so he was the cop's dog. or was he your dog? i guess that was astupid question to ask. let's ask kaji himself. show our guest the way. so you're a dirty rat andyou had me fooled, too. i'd like to knowwho asked you to do it. i just felt sorry for the girl,so i decided to let her go. i'll make you wishthat you'd talked. - idiot!- bastard! idiot! it's useless to beat me up. useless, huh?

why? better calling plan or...?- it's a more secure line. there's nothing covert about this visit. i'm just lecturing about fundamentalismto a bunch of colonels. first of all, it's not just a lecture. these military-to-military exchangeshelp keep the peace. it's a big deal. i feel special again. thanks. you think anyone gets invitedto these things, especially at the behestof foreign minister gorev? guess he forgot i once refusedto give his daughter an a. do the world a favor;don't remind him of that. now, that is a secure line, so that we can, you know, talkwithout any borises listening in. just in case you have trouble stayingwarm on those long winter nights. - i was not sleeping!- you were! - i was meditating.- you were snoring in the middle of... - i was not. was i?- yes! but you find thatincredibly sexy though. - snoring!- come on, it's not an old thing! - it was a... it was a boring movie.- no. come on, i'm so with it.look, come on. look at my phone. look at all theapplications and life hacks i have here. life hacks! - whoa.- what?

- well, who posted it?- alison! alison, it's her account. god, i'm gonna kill her. and that's...that's, that's harrison, right? the president's son? yeah. sort of breaks your heartto see him before all the bad choices. - i don't see what the big deal is.- he's the president's son, ali! that makes it a big deal!plus, he really needs privacy right now. - what does that mean?- just take the picture down! are you freaking out because there issomething going on between you? i already told you, we datedfor three weeks when i was your age. we are just friends.but it is really important to me that he feels like i am someonethat he can trust. - please be more mysterious.- look, i don't want him thinking that i'm going around telling peoplethat i'm \\\"one half of starrison.\\\" and according to this,not the cute half. girls, i'm leaving. come say do svidaniya. let's go say do svidaniya. - morning, all.- morning. nadine tells mei have a very full schedule today. starting with the russian war gamesoff the alaskan coast. they began this morning. a flotilla ofsome 50 different vessels and aircraft. they're technically within their rights. the maneuvers and test firings aretaking place outside american airspace. still insultingly closeto our northern borders. we were expecting something like this.after the nato thing? yes, it's believed to be a responseto our announced deployment of the natorapid response strike force in latvia. which was our response to russia'smeddling in its neighbors' affairs. moldova being the most recent example. white house expects usto send a d\\u00e3\\u00a9marche, a diplomatic cable in protest. the nato force in latviawas the right call. i'm just annoyed that ostrov isso determined to refight the cold war, instead of fixing his crappy economy. don't put that in the protest thingy. speaking of the cold war, there's a ceremony todayfor ezra lyle helsinger, the department'soldest foreign service officer. he's retiring todayafter 60 years of service. wow. 60 years? good for him. i'm sorry. ma'am?you're needed in the situation room. elizabeth. what's up?blake couldn't give me any details. - that's because it's need to know.- ok, what do i need to know? russian war games have gotten heated. one of their subs split from the fleetand crossed into us coastal waters. not unprecedented. russians like to test our defenses,like we test theirs. but we were tracking the suband it vanished. that is unprecedented. so they've perfectedsome kind of cloaking technology. and the sub's nuclear armed. it's somewhere off the alaska shoreline,intentions unknown. could be posturing.could be about to start world war iii. - what's ostrov saying?- we tried calling. we're told he's at a remote location.he can't be reached. so he's vanished. heck of a weekfor henry to go to russia. can't disagree with you there. thank you. professor mccord,you are most welcome. - thank you, minister gorev.- you must call me anton. even after i wouldn't giveyour daughter an a? i overreached in asking.an \\\"incomplete\\\" was generous. well, good.i'm glad we cleared the air on that. as am i. indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetingsbetween our militaries. to keep the air clear. especially in a timeof such unfortunate misunderstandings. thank you very much.it's an honor to be here. i'm gonna speak with you todayabout a subject that is of great importance to our twocountries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfareor struggle. namely, jihad in classical islam and in both eastern and westernchristianity, the concept of crusade. professor mccord, may i introducethe president of the russian federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,pavel ostrov? professor mccord,it is an honor to meet you. it's also my honor, mr president,and a bit of a surprise. i like to come to this placeon occasion for a visit. for the beautiful country,the recreation and for the game. i'm told you enjoy blood sports. if, by that, you mean hunting, then, yes, my father took me sometimes. deer, duck, an occasional squirrel. then you must come hunt with me.no refusing. my pleasure is to showthe goodness of russian life to such eminent, distinguished guest. with such a beautiful, eminent wife. mr president, we've been in contact.they deny that sub is even there. still claiming their rightto refute reality. what do we know about the sub itself? we think it's the yalta, sir.it's a new sub out of vladivostok with experimental stealth technologymore advanced than ours. - apparently.- it's powered by a fission reactor, carrying six bulava-typecruise missiles, each with 150-kiloton warheadand a range of about 60 miles. but again,what is most disturbing about it... besides the fact that it could beon its way to flatten anchorage. is how they have just proven that they can evadeall forms of detection by sonar, magnetic anomalyor satellite array. a true stealth weapon. they can hit usbefore we even know they're there. ostrov's been bankrupting his economy, trying to get back to military paritywith the west. - now he may have it.- they've got the drop on us. what do they want? is ostrov just making us sweator is this more than posturing? sir, if ostrov isn't talking to us,i may know somebody who will. nadine, can you clear my schedulefor the rest of the day? - all of it, ma'am?- and, nadine, quietly, ok? - get gorev on sivits, please.- yes, ma'am. is everything ok, ma'am? yeah, it's fine.i just need to clear my schedule. it's definitely a loose nuke.we're all dead. there's a bunker in the basement. ok, that's enough doomsday.you heard the secretary. let's clear her schedule. quietly. - she's fun!- i heard that. don't try and evade the issue and don't try telling methat this sub isn't there. anton. it's just the two of us now. yes, two friendstalking openly and honestly, but friends also don't put powerfulweapons on each other's borders. hmm. i'm listening.i thought it might come to this. so, say one of our subsdid lose its direction and come too close to your alaskawith its bears and salmon. you're about to put nato troopson the latvian border, just a few hundred miles from moscow. which is less friendly? - so, what can we do about that?- cancel the nato deployment and perhaps the captainwill find his map again. come back home.honest enough for you? perfectly. you also know i'm being honest wheni tell you that bullying and threats will not alter the resolveof the united states or its allies. and your presidentneeds to pick up the phone. i will tell him myself when i see him.he can't have gone far. - what are you talking about?- didn't you know? president ostrov has invited yourhusband henry to go hunting with him. they're in the woods, hunting grouse. one of president ostrov'sfavorite pastimes. it's quite an honor for your husband. is that what it is? i'm certain they're havinga wonderful time. well, all i can say is...they better be. until later, madam secretary. sorry. hunt requires quiet, professor. we are not having very much luck today. maybe the camera crewhave something to do with it. i don't understand. with this gun,i always have very good luck. - oh, it's beautiful.- my grandfather's. he kept it with him in the greatpatriotic war, your world war ii, during the blockade leningrad. - the siege of leningrad?- you know it? yes, of course. through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cockedand loaded by the front door, so if the germans ever break through, if they come to the housefor my aunts and my grandmother, he has somethingto shoot the enemy with. and if necessary...his family and then himself. may i ask, sir,why you're telling me all this? our peopleare never frightened, professor, and we outlast our enemy. so, tell your wife and your president,we don't back down. i will convey your message,mr president. but to be honest, i have no ideawhat you're talking about. don't worry. they will. he did what? yeah.my left ear is still ringing. now i know what that was all about.he was using me for propaganda. let's just hope that's all you are. - you think he'd take me hostage?- i don't know. clearly, he coordinatedthe sub incursion with your visit. it's just optics. lecturingthe secretary of state's husband while his sub is sneaking around alaska? the message is,don't let nato troops go into latvia. well, now that we've heard it,why don't you come home? no, if i cut and run now,he'll just know that we're scared. i should act like everything is fine. they've invited me to touran orthodox monastery of st george. i think i should go. besides,it's a significant historical site, crucial to the spread of christianityduring mongol rule. i am finding your dorkinessoddly reassuring right now. we need you in there. henry, i gotta go. - be safe, ok?- i will. ok. henry alright? as long as the only actual shotsbeing fired are at a bunch of defenseless birds,yeah, i think we're alright. this is ostrov grandstanding.clearly, the man likes to put on a show. what do you propose? if he wants to grandstand,hide and seek with the sub, and whatever he's trying to dowith the secretary's husband, we should put on a show right back. not only mobilizethe strike force to latvia, but deploy the sixth fleet's flagshipto the black sea. turkey will allow it,but it's posturing. it's us doing exactly what ostrovis doing, only bigger and louder. surest sign of strengthis to show you are able to use it. but are we willing to use it, sir? i think we just got a signalthrough your husband, bess. all this russian presidenttruly understands or respects is force. - give the order to move the fleet.- yes, sir. we've cleared the secretary's schedule,but one item's proving tricky. - and that is?- ezra helsinger's retirement ceremony. she's expected to give a speechor at least make an appearance. - today's his last day.- he's a living legend. everyone's gonna be there,including press. m-sec doesn't show, there'll be rumors. i'll let her know. keep it on for now. speaking of rumors, i'm hearingthe pentagon's parking lot is hopping. people coming in insteadof going home? never a good sign. yup, we're all about to be fraggedby a fiery ball of death. it was nice to know you. daisy, something you should see. you know the secretary'sso protective of the family? \\\"let them say what they will about me, so long as they leavethe kids out of it?\\\" the kids are not out of it. well, the secretary'snot gonna love this, but it just looks likeyour typical internet rumors. daisy, you have a phone call. - it's the secretary's daughter.- or not. she's at the mouth of glacier bay, resting on a seabedin 100 meters of water. within the 12-mile limit. a violationof our territorial sovereignty. aerial recon detected a burstof very low-frequency transmission. they're fairly certainthey were attempting to communicatewith their command vessel. since then, nothing. no distress signal, no response toour radio transmissions or hydrophone. ostrov still isn't picking up his phone.what's his game, bess? trying to back us out of latviai thought. but to be honest, at this moment, sir,i don't know. is there an optic cableburied along that coast? land-linked to our anti-missiletracking stations up north. so, it could be a spy missiontrying to tap that cable. yes, and it hassix nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying juno55 miles down that channel! it could be awaiting orders! if they wanted to nuke us,they have icbms that could obliterate new yorkin 20 minutes. why park a sub off of alaska? juno would be gone in 30 seconds. and then the sub would disappeardown the coast to seattle, la. how longbefore we can physically engage? you mean threaten it, sir?capture it and report it? i mean destroy it. sir, our closest surface vesselis the navy minesweeper kirkland. it can be at the site within 90 minutes. tell the russians they have two hours. two hours for that sub to be goneor we take it out ourselves, by whatever means necessary. which the russianswill view as an act of war. and this isn't? can't say we didn't warn them. sorry i'm late. so, we're gonna pay tribute tomr helsinger just like nothing's wrong. yes, ma'am. is anything wrong? uh, nothing we're talking about. ma'am, your speechdoesn't need to be formal. just a few unrehearsed,off-the-cuff remarks. and here they are. great. six decades of service in germany,eastern europe and the middle east, a crewman for a vanderbilt yacht and a writer for timeand the paris review. ezra, you truly are a witness to and a creator ofwhat your first boss, henry luce, called \\\"the american century.\\\" thank you. enjoy your life. and have some cake! yeah, sure, sure. oh, please, don't get up, ezra. i'm very sorry.i was supposed to bring you your gift. but we're a little disorganized today. there's no need to apologize, ma'am.the threat of war with the russians? that's apt to frazzle a person. and on the very daythat the last of the cold warriors shuffles off to buffalo too.how's that for irony? has someone been telling you things? i have seen this movie before,madam secretary. the russian navy holding war gamesin the bering sea. i... i happened to see a little itemon the dod daily rundown this morning. we are sending a naval flagshipinto the black sea. ostrov is posturing on russian tv. and with your husband, no less. he's a handsome fella, by the way. you've cleared your calendar. except for those eventswhere your absence would be noticed. you really do knowhow to read the signs. now, tell that to the dmv.they took my damn license! you still work for me, for the nextseveral hours anyway, right? um... yeah. till five o'clock. so, there's this invisible submarine,a super weapon, it's just sitting there,letting us look at it. right! i was wondering about that too. i mean, why turn offthe stealth technology? well, back in my day, we only tried to readthe russians' intentions. their mentality. to look at the chess playeras well as the pieces on the board. well, that's sort of tough since ostrovwon't even admit there's a game. not even talking. but see,that in itself tells us something. i mean, he's a bully and a poser, right? well, the question iswhy isn't he bragging? throwing this in our face? right... right. why... why not tell the russian public or the whole world, for that matter, that he snuck advanced technology inright under our noses? beat us at our own game. in our backyard. and you're right. you know,it isn't like ostrov to hold back. unless there's somethinghe didn't count on. - something went wrong.- hm-hmm. that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. and again... ostrovwould never admit that, would he? makes you wish it was him sitting herenow instead of me, doesn't it, so you could ask him? you do knowthere's no smoking in here? hm-hmm. oh, yeah, yeah. an ordinance against smokingin this building since 1997, i think. i miss the war. i, too, have great respectfor st nicholas. stop filming.what are you doing here, henry? your tour of the church is over. i mean, st george is great.the warrior saint. the victor. but st nick represents compassion. he's the one you turn towhen times are tough. of course,we've trivialized him in the west, made him into the precursorof our modern-day santa claus. what is your point? thought that maybewe would light a candle together. i don't think so. i'm in no need of miracles.you may be. not me. so, we clear? no more pictures.nothing personal. - no posting where others can see.- and? absolutely nothing involvingthe first family or the white house. - thank you.- ok, then, leave it to me. i'll see what i can do to keep majornews outlets from picking up the story. - without telling mom?- yeah, no. it'll all be fine.besides, the best defense is the truth. and since you and harrisonaren't actually an item... you'd tell me if you were, right?honestly, he is kind of cute. - i mean, i'd understand.- no, i have a boyfriend, ok? - oh, yeah? who's that?- it's just this guy that i work with. another internfrom the microloan program? - uh...- wait, what's with the face? are you, like, dating your bossor something? oh, my god.wait, are you dating arthur gilroy? - yeah. look, i know it sounds...- stevie, no. forget harrison.now we have a problem. mom and dad are fine with it. sort of. they may be fine as parents,but from a press perspective, looking at damage control? there are three wordsthat can never go together in this town, and that is \\\"boss,\\\" \\\"intern\\\" and \\\"sex.\\\" - you've gotta end it. now.- what? why? what do you think will happen whenit comes out about you two? and it will. i will deal with it. the microloan programwas on the chopping block. people would loveto get back at your mother. they'd happily throw arthur gilroyonto the fire to do that. you really thinkthat's what will happen? i know it will. this is st nicholas we're talking about?as in kris kringle? he means something morein orthodox tradition. he's the one you turn toin cases of calamity, when things have turned against you. just an observation,but he seemed like a different person. like he was afraid, even. - afraid of what?- i don't know. but i know when true believersare really praying, and ostrov was. the guy that took me huntingthis afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way. could something have happenedto change that? as a matter of fact, something did. henry, i gotta take thisto the president. if ostrov is scared, it may bebecause he's lost control of that sub. you think he could overreact? that or we will. - at this point, it's academic.- wait. the deadline isn't up yet! i'm overriding it.we've got the russians' response. two battle cruisersand three sister attack subs are on a direct course to glacier bay. carrier strike group is on its way to intercept. the sub hasn't budged. the kirkland's stationed over it, aboutto commence dropping depth charges. why? standard naval etiquette. you don't surrender,we force you to surface. the kirkland.we are directly above the target. we are about to drop depth charges. three, two, one. standing by.something's happening. fish in the water.target has launched a torpedo. initiating countermeasures. we are hit.repeat, the kirkland has been hit. sir, we've lost communicationwith the kirkland. carrier strike group has re-establishedcontact with the kirkland. - damage assessment?- injuries. so far, no fatalities. a visual from a medi-chopper.ship is under power, headed for port. norad reports a squadron of russianmig-35s just performed a flyover. - saw the kirkland take the hit.- damn it! i've got northcom and thecommander of the us pacific fleet requesting immediate authorityto engage. a communiqu\\u00e3\\u00a9 from the russians.their vessel was defending itself. any further attack will be met withquote \\\"overwhelming retaliatory force.\\\" without getting into specifics. call their bluff, sir.they're guilty of an act of war. all due respect,we don't know who's guilty of what. i'm just saying, mr president,before we declare war, let's determine exactlywho we're going to war with. what if that sub hasn't movedbecause it's incapable of moving? what if something went wrong? that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. the captain and crewcould be operating without orders, off the chain of command of the kremlinand his president. what does it matter?we respond to actions, not intentions. we do not let an attackon american lives go unanswered. and we don't go to war over a mistake! outside. ostrov lost control of the yaltabecause your husband knows religion and he saw ostrov ask santa for a wish? the secretary's husband has shownhe can be a pretty effective operative, as well as a religious scholar. well, what if i trust your analysis? say ostrov is scared, operatingin the blind, like we all are here. - then what?- we don't push him to the brink. not until we know more. every second we waitlets those battleships get closer or lets the sub fire another missileor six of them, all of them nukes. if we hit it with one of ours,it's got a 10k reactor on board. we risk sending a radioactive tsunamidown the channel... that'll make fukushima a fond memory.i get it, bess. so, what do you propose? we have to take one last chanceand try and talk to that submarine. directly and without moscow knowing. there has to be a way. that's the unmanned submersible.if the russian crew gets a visual, they'll know it's harmless,incapable of attack. we're tapping on their hull. we're using the retractable armto tap out a message. - morse code.- old school, but it works. we're asking them to statetheir name, mission, allow us on board. that's them answering. there's activity. one of her torpedo tubesis opening, flooding. she's gonna fire. no. it's her distress buoy. they're asking for help. stephanie! are you and harrison dalton dating?is he a good kisser? stephanie, is it true?are you and harrison dalton dating? hey, you ok? yeah, i'm not used to being ambushed. yeah, you've had a lot of pings. you're gettingsome serious unwanted attention. yeah, they were outside my house.and then on the street. it's crazy. don't worry. you and harrison are justfilling bandwidth between kardashians. it's gonna blow over soon.none of this matters. listen to me, what matters is our work. right? the microloans program,that's what matters. yeah, about that... hey, you're not quitting, are you? oh, you're quitting this. us. both. i'm quitting... i'm quitting both. look, once they figure outthat i'm not dating harrison, they're going to figure outwho i am dating. so what? you really wanna throw awayyour whole career on some intern? i know i've harped on this a lot,but i have been around, ok? just let me... let me worry about that. look, ok, you know what?you're too old. you're too old and it's not gonna work. is that what you need to hear? uh, ok. ok. it's been really nice working with you. listen to me, do you really wanna losewhat means so much to you? please, just take a few daysand think about the job, not me. the job. ok. i have to go. see you around, kid. see you around, old man. he's the executive officerof the russian submarine, the yalta. they're transmitting from the bridge. they have an antennaattached to their distress buoy. they suffered a malfunctionwhen the new technology failed. there was a fire in the control room.they couldn't contain it. a loss of oxygen. 42 crew members have already died. that's two-thirds of their crew. the captain broke radio silenceto report it. we received instructions. do not signal for help. do not allow the americans to board. if you can't restore power,then destroy the sub and all evidenceof new deflector technology. anything to keep usfrom getting our hands on it. ask why they fired the torpedo. the captain panicked. he thought they were being attacked. the captain's no longer in commandof the vessel. nice way of saying they mutinied. we only have two hours of oxygen left.we're asking for your help. please help us. please... help us. the russian battle cruiserhas reached our line of quarantine. we tell the russians we're gettingthose men out, they'll refuse. they're close enoughto send out a missile and destroy it themselvesbefore we touch it. so, no good options. ostrov will never admit failure or concedethat one of his crews mutinied. not in public. there may be a way to resolve this. a deal that even he can live with. butwe need to go through back channels. and we happen to have one. we do. it's an interesting offer. president dalton will confirm it's real.you can call him directly. i'm sure it's genuine,but i wonder if there are alternatives. the alternative is a returnto the days of the cold war, sir. there was a time whenour two countries, our two grandfathers, fought on the same side. mine survived a siege too. bastogne. the battle of the bulge. at the end of the war, he exchanged cigaretteswith russian soldiers on the elbe river. traveling here, i thought of him.he would've been happy. he knew first-handwhat our countries could accomplish when they work togetherfor the common good. i wear this in honor of mine. - st nicholas.- my grandfather's name saint. nikolai is an old family name. he, too, may have been happyto see us here in peace. perhaps this iswhat he sacrificed so much for. i will call your president. the fire occurred on the yaltaafter an accidental nighttime collision between the russiannuclear-powered submarine and the us minesweeper kirkland. the disabled sub then driftedinto american territorial waters where us naval personnel boarded itin an attempted rescue. tragically, they found no survivors. - crew members will be buried at sea.- poor guys. what a way to go. i'm just glad that thingsdidn't escalate with russia. - look who i brought.- mr helsinger. - we thought you'd left.- your tour of duty ended yesterday. well, i figured one more daywouldn't matter. also, they told mei still had to pick up my gift. oh, yes, the secretarywanted to give that to you personally. it'll just be a few more minutes. i'll wait. getting used to that, waiting. oh, yeah. interestinghow all that turned out, isn't it? - very sad story.- uh-huh. but defense is handling it.we had nothing to do with it. still, it is very interesting. and it is a story. kind of makes you wonderwhat really happened. hmm. these are all of them? all 20 survivors of the yalta.a few hours ago. being given a top-secretand strictly classified welcome aboard the uss teddy roosevelt. the russians will be announcing thattheir remains have been buried at sea. so we'll leave it to themto make sure the story holds up. as you said,they are good at refuting reality. - ostrov accepted the deal?- yes, sir. they'll all get new lives andidentities, here in the united states. the price for letting us rescue them.unbelievable. in all fairness, sir, we did geta chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealthtechnology before giving it back. at least those poor bastardswon't get sent home and shot for mutiny. but they will never seetheir families again. not even to let them knowthat they're alive. any contactputs their loved ones in danger. all so that ostrovcould save face. hell of a thing. sir, the nato forcesare still deploying to latvia and the yalta situationdidn't spiral out of control. - we won this round.- yeah. the world did not blow up on our watch. for at least another day or two. probably my first day on the job. i could not believei was meeting the old man. - whoa. is that john foster dulles?- yeah. the architect of permanent peacein europe. stood up to soviet aggression. that picture was taken the day presidenteisenhower and secretary dulles signed the treatybringing germany into nato. he always said that,\\\"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the...\\\" \\\"the necessary art.\\\" would you guys give us a minute? - congratulations, sir.- thank you. - a pleasure.- mine. i never even asked youwhere you were going. oh, um... prague. budapest, berlin. you ever thinkyou'd live to see the day when the wall came down,open borders, free elections? sometimes we wondered if we'd liveto see the next five minutes. but somehow we understoodthat if we just kept talking... in the end, the sovietsdidn't want to push that button any more than we did. there was a... a rationality to it,crazy as it seems. mutually assured destruction. yeah, but your new enemies today,they have no such qualms. they wanna push that buttonand there's no holding them back. that's a bit grim, isn't it? i don't know. makes me feel naive for being hopeful. oh, you'll be fine. i've seen a lot of them come and go. i think you're the one for the job. - ezra.- madam secretary. you and i should keep talking. well, for what it's worth,ali feels terrible about \\\"starrison.\\\" i know she does. it's ok. and i'm sorry about \\\"starthur.\\\" let's not go crazy with the names. i think that you did a very adult thing. but i know it was hardand i'm so sorry that you're hurting. - come here.- thanks. - sweetie.- well, at least dad will be overjoyed. but he'll hide it well,which is all you can ask for. hm-hmm. this is nice, by the way. you going to an event tonight? i am. the mccord family dinner.soon as dad gets back. oh. yeah, i don't... i don't knowif i'm up for that. well, get up for it. we're celebrating. - why?- because we can. because we're here. dad's home! come on! get your coats. we founda place with awesome vegan options. - i did.- that's nice. listen, i just want you to knowthat even when it's hard and no matterhow much it hurts right now, it is not the end of the world, ok? where are they? here they are. i missed you guys. what do you think? - oh, i think it's awful.- hi. hi. oh, mom texted me. i'm so sorry, honey. - nice try, dad.- i mean it, honey. - hey...- come on. let's get some food, please. - let's go, guys.- wait. let me just get my coat. - dad, can i wear the hat?- no. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from  \",\n          \"\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bf \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:   previously on reign: lord castleroy. i know i'm notthe man of your dreams. will you accept my humble proposal?

be proud of your sons. i am. forward! no. no... watch out! don't hit lola! i'm fine.i'm not that far along yet. it wasn't so long ago we were alltalking about our first kisses? - now you're all married.- and soon you will be as well. unless i ruin it before then. or my father does. he's arriving today,and i'm worried he'll offend lord castleroywith too small a dowry. we can't afford much. have you told lord castleroyyour family's lost its fortune? he might be understanding. tell a suitor we're broke?my father would have a heart attack. i've had more opportunitiesthan you can count. and what do i do? fall in love with a servantand nearly ruin his life, too. we've all had the same opportunity,and look at us. i never dreamt that i'd be wed toa bastard with an imaginary title. lola's been forced to hide herpregnancy. even mary and francis... yes, when we couldn't cometo terms on my brother, my beloved husbandlocked me in a tower. it's been almost a month. are you and francison any better terms? well, i can now talkto him without screaming. does that count as \\\"better\\\"? your majesty?i have dire news from scotland. it's about your mother,marie de guise. the protestants and theirlords of the congregation have sent an army to besiegemy mother in edinburgh. there are men outside thecastle demanding her surrender. her friends don't know how muchlonger she can hold out for. mary, i'm so sorry. my brother james warnedus that the protestants were planning a rebellionagainst my mother. if i had gone with him,i could have stopped it. or you could've been killed. this news only proves it. it's too badwe couldn't protect my mother by locking her in thetower as you did with me. instead of arguing,let's help her. your mother needs soldiersand quickly. and how are we supposed to get them?certainly not from your father. armies can be bought. who has that kind of money? my mother. francis, i've already askedyour mother. more than once. - she's always said no.- then we will ask her together. and we will keep askinguntil she says yes. mother, we need to talk. i realize that.why do you think i sent for you two? oh, you sent for us?so you've heard the news then? i'm sorry, mary.you must be crushed. well, i'm worried, i'm not crushed. there's still timeto send reinforcements. oh, dear. i don't think we'retalking about the same news. have you not heardabout the succession? whose succession? not yours, i'm afraid. word came from england.it's official. elizabeth will be their next queen. - mary tudor's dead?- no! the old bitch is stillclinging to her miserable life. but she managed to cough up the gallto hand over her crown to elizabeth. a bastard, a protestant no less,and not my son's wife! are you even pregnant yet? could you possibly beany less use to france? do not talk to my wife that way.she's a queen and an ally. she was supposed to get me england! we've been feedingand housing this ally for most of her pointless life.and what have we gotten? a drain on our treasure and army, an endless paradeof dramas and headaches. scotland protects france by engagingthe english on two fronts so it cannot focus its forceon growing its foothold on your backyard, calais. i don't need a lecturefrom you on geography. scotland cannot bluntthe english threat alone, your grace. - especially not now!- yes, i've heard all about it. protestants threatening your mother.she needs reinforcements - just like always.- no, not just like always. she is under siege.there are soldiers at her gates! and now you're afraidyour poor mother might die? well, don't we owe itto scotland and france, as rulers, to ask if thatmight be a good thing? your mother can't handlethe job that you gave her. or else she wouldn't be under siege! father, stop this. mary's crown is at stake,which puts france at risk as well. more than her crown is at stake. your mother failed us completely. and now they wanther head on a pike. be careful. or yours might follow. no one? not one country or lord offers help? my mother is a catholic ally. she is under attack. enemies screaming for her head,and no one cares? scotland has many friends at court. but every conversation i have with anoble or diplomat ends the same way. \\\"we're with you, dauphin,but what does the king say?\\\" i hope you didn't tell them. mary, i should neverhave let my father... words don't bother me. you are safe in this castle. - not even my mother...- threats don't bother me, either. losing bothers me. - mary, that's silly, you're...- a queen? yes, i am. but one with scant power here. and less every day back home. on the other hand, i'm also queenbecause i'm a de guise. i have very powerful uncles. i hope you're not thinking... my mother is surroundedon all sides. protestants are burningand pillaging catholic churches. why would they stop theircampaign of destruction before making sure i losemy mother and my crown? but the duke of guise? ever since you've been back at court, you've chosento keep your distance from him. the same as my parents have. your uncle is a dangerouslyambitious man, who has built himself an army bystealing recruits from their mothers. and paying them well. do you know anyone elsewith an army as large or as loyal? loyal to him. and him only. is that someone that you can trust? he is my uncle. if that doesn't buy mehis loyalty, well... trust is a luxuryi can no longer afford. sorry, you're not to be letin under any circumstances. do you know who i am? you're the contest winnerthe king enjoyed. and then cast aside. penelope, what are you doing here? surely a bounty of demeaning tasksawaits you in the kitchen. - i need to see the king immediately.- hmm. i'm pregnant. with his child. you're not pregnant. even if you are,it's not with the king's child. well, the king will want to know. he's going to wonder if he's gotanother chance at happiness. another chance at a childhe could truly love! shut her up now. henry, i love you and i miss you!and i'm carrying your child! you're pregnant? you're certain it's my child? there's been no one else,your majesty. - i was a maiden when you took me.- oh, that's nonsense. see that she's taken care of. set her up with a cottagein one of the villages. oh! i have some mistresses. in bernay, i think. the child could havesiblings to play with, huh? wait. that's all i get? henry! it's more than you deserve. are you sure you wantto be playing this game? if you overplay it, if he losespatience with your displays, you won't like how it ends. the two dead girls before you didn't. nothing bothers me more than problemsi've already solved coming back to be problems again. if that's what you makeof yourself, my child, expect me to make youa lesson to my other problems by grinding you into the dustyou no longer see fit to sweep. oh-oh-oh!oh, i've missed you two so much! father. where's mother? she's at homewith your other sisters. i've only brought these twoso you could introduce them to potential suitors. aren't they a little youngto be looking for husbands? considering all thetrouble we've had with you, i regret not bringing them sooner. and i hope you haven't made toolarge a mess for me to clean up. i realize i made a mistake, but it'snot as bad as you may have heard. no? tell me, will there be any surprises for lord castleroyon your wedding night? anything he can accuse you of later? no, it didn't go that far. does that embarrass you? then imagine howit embarrassed the family. i may sound harsh,but it's for your own good. you can't affordto lose another suitor. do i have it wrong? no, father. i stopped by our new houseon the way back. it needs workbefore we can live there. especially if we want tobring it to your standards. bash, that's lovely,but what happened out there? you've been outin those woods for weeks hunting that creature.have you found it yet? the darkness? no sign of it yet,but it's only a matter of time. the blood wood is vast,but not limitless. have you been all right? i hope there haven't beenany more encounters with the king. i've been staying out of his way. waiting for you to return. why do you stop? it's not our first kiss.you're my husband, it's all right. it's not as though i'm inexperienced. i'm well aware of that. well, if you wanted a virgin... no, i don't.but i care about your experience. i know not all of it has been good. there's no changing that now. i disagree. what are you doing? helping you forget everythingand everyone that's come before this. tell me what you want... very specifically.leave nothing out. all right. do you have any ideawhat you've done? francis, you should havetalked her out of this madness. you should have helped her. i know you're a student of history. perhaps you missed this chapter: the duke was dismissedfrom your father's court for grasping at too much power. and you know what he did then? he fielded that armyto grasp at more. he's a vicious self-serving killer,a threat to any throne. coming from you,that's a ringing endorsement. i wouldn't be so smug, my dear. you just let the devil into our home. thank you so much for coming, uncle. we wish it was underbetter circumstances. like your wedding, perhaps? i seem to have missed my invitationto that happy event, your grace. the wedding was very rushed.i hope you took no offense. nonsense. don't troubleyourself over niceties. i don't. dauphin. the king and queensend their regards. they regretnot greeting you personally, but urgent mattersdemand their attention. you don't have to make excuses. i'm aware of your parents'opinion of me. and from what i hear,even when your father is present, the king is no longer in the castle. i don't know what rumorsyou've heard, sir, but... call me christian,and let's spare ourselves lots of pointless formalityand posturing. i have friends who tell mewhat goes on in this castle. i know why you asked for me, and i'm here toget you out of the hole my sister's incompetence put you in. very well, no posturing. my mother is in danger,but i'm guessing that it will take more thanfamily loyalty to buy your help. so what will it be? money? land? neither. your father dismissedme from court years ago. i want a position in court again. a more permanent one. lord magistrate of france will do. the lord magistrateis the king's right hand. you want a better position thanthe one that you were stripped of after you challenged your king? i didn't challenge my king,i served him. by appointing generalswithout his permission and doling out political patronageto your friends? while your father was busy producingheirs, bastards and otherwise, he needed my help,whether he cared to admit it or not. he needed your loyalty, whetheryou cared to provide it or not. i can make your army serveme for nothing if i wanted. i have that authority. they're right outsideif you'd like to try. i just don't know how many will stillbe around tomorrow if i'm not. they're loyalto the man who pays them, not the boy who waves crowns at them. we'll consider the termsand present them to henry. uncle. your father will never agree. he has to. or you'll lose scotland,and so will we. hurry up!i mean, i want you and everything, but we must be quick. what's the meaning of this? sorry, your majesty, i was just... i know what you were just,you vile little man. have you no decency? laying your handson a favorite of your king? leave, before i have youthrown in the dungeon! i hope he didn't hurt you. - no.- i got here just in time, didn't i? if that man had had his way, he'd be able to claimyour unborn child, and where would thatleave you with the king? i'm already pregnant.my child is the king's. then i'm sure you'll agreeit's not just yourself that you need to protect anymore. the life of the king'sunborn baby is at stake. we simply can't risk that. you need to go somewhere safe. the king will be outragedwhen he finds out you're locking meand his baby in here. no, the king will be outragedwhen \\\"his\\\" baby comes out looking more likeone of his stable boys. or, more likely,no baby comes out at all. neither of those things will happen. enjoy your solitude, my dear. i'll drop by every month or so to share in the joy ofwatching your belly grow. wait! don't leave me here! a word of advicefrom someone who knows: don't make friends with the rats.they bite. wait, wait. greer tells me her sisters havenever been to a castle before. i say we give them the royal tour. that can wait. i'd like to discuss the matterof greer's dowry as soon as possible. now? in front of your daughters? we don't need to discussgreer's dowry. i've given the matter some thought,and i'm not interested. not interested? then what is it you want? only your blessing for her hand. you have it, my lord. i can't tell you how happythat makes me. i need to speakwith you, father. it's urgent. - nothing is more urgent than war.- i agree. that's why i came to discussa solution for scotland. all this time we've been waitingfor mary tudor to give us england. to allow us the privilegeof putting your wife on the throne. but the english don't wait. they take what they want,just like they took calais from us. so i'm going to take it back. after that,i'll take all of england. we'll attack from scotlandin the north and calais in the south. when they wake up tomorrowto see french soldiers massing around calais,we might even get lucky. they might surrender to sparethemselves certain defeat. tomorrow? how could you...? i can't wait to see thelook on mary tudor's face when i claimthe english throne for myself. i just hope that sick cow liveslong enough for me to execute her. father, tomorrow? - what have you done?- can't you read? general brantome's men are movingnortheast from rouen as we speak. general brantome? i had to relieve laval.no imagination. no courage. stop babbling, father,and tell me the truth. - did you do this?- why wouldn't i? we don't have the strengthto take calais. our armies are spread too thin,all over europe! if we lose,and they capture our forces, they can stage an invasion andsweep down through france unopposed! but francis, we can't lose! yes, we can, and we will! father, thousands will die. you don't understand. \\\"blessed be the lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.\\\" i prayed for his guidance, and he spoke to mein a glorious waking dream. he said that i wouldclaim victory at calais! son, be happy with me! thanks to your father,you are going to rule half of europe! francis? what's the matter?you look like you've seen a ghost. i have.it's father, he's gone utterly mad. define \\\"utterly,\\\"because this is a man who's ridden a pigthrough the throne room in nothing but his under things. mother, he is starting a war. - what?- he's attacking calais. oh, francis. your father,is that what he told you? - it's all over his maps.- darling, relax. i've taken general lavalinto my confidence. he knows to do nothingwithout my approval. general laval has been dismissed. brantome's in charge now. who's brantome? oh, yes, i forgot. he's the new one henry brought in to replace laval when herefused to rename the fifth army \\\"god's gauls.\\\" don't worry, brantome's with us. all of these dismissed generals. i'm beginning to guesshow mary's uncle knows so much. what will you do when father realizesyour contravening all his orders? tomorrow he'll beinvading the spanish. the next day the dutch. when he starts rememberingwho he invaded yesterday, perhaps his wits will have returned, and this whole nightmarewill be over. darling, relax. if i left things to chance, we'd still be bowingto queen penelope. i promise, it's under control. for france's sake,i hope you're right. no. not yet. you know, we can stop all this. it worked.i've forgotten all about... you see, i can't even rememberwhat his name is anymore. good. there's still morethat i want you to forget. oh, in that case, i'll forget thatyou told me not to take off my skirt. that's not what i mean. i want you to forget... every boy who ever smiled at you. every man who ever flirted with you. everyone but me. were the guards necessary? surely a messengerwould have sufficed. i wanted to speak to you alone,away from your men. but not away from your men, i see. have you spoken with your father? the king will not agreeto the position you want. you never asked him, did you? we both know it was a fool's errand. there is something elsethat you want from me. are you going to tell me,or am i meant to guess? wise men look to the future. they're patient. when i started to buildmy army a decade ago, other men saw a ragtag rabble. i saw what it would become: a bargaining chipthat would one day bring kings to me, begging for favors. you never expected to befather's lord magistrate. you want to be mine, when i'm king,even if you have to be patient. i won't have to be patient for long,i don't think. is it poison, i wonder,that is driving him mad? i don't trust youand i don't like you. well, being liked is a king's job,not his lieutenant's. everything in me saysi should say no. and yet you are here...away from your wife. i think you knewyou might have to say yes, and she would object. she would pay any priceto save scotland, but would never ask you to. she knows how your familyfeels about me. well, you've just explainedto me why i love her. enough to have her lockedin a tower, i've heard. do you want this positionor don't you? i want the chanceto serve a great ruler. great rulers aren't afraid ofthe truth, no matter how painful. the truth is, you love your wife. the truth is, she needs me. so what will it be... my prince? when i am king,the position is yours. but i have one condition. your men will report to meas they would to you. - but why would you need my men to...- i'm going with you to scotland. well, that's unwise. and if you die,your promise to me is worth nothing. well, then,i suggest you keep me alive. are you serious? my uncle agreed? he'll send enough men to scotlandto quell the rebellion and save my mother? yes. i'd almost lost all hope. francis, how did you manage it? i convinced the dukethat it was in his best interests. - i'll explain when i'm back.- back? back from where? i am going with him to scotland. what? francis, no. mary, i have to. it's the only way that i canassure your mother's safety. and what of your safety? well, the duke getsnothing if i don't survive. with a man like that,i can't imagine a better guarantee. francis, i don't know what to say. you're saving my country,my mother, and you're risking your lifein the bargain. you needn't say anything. i've only kept my promise. as a king and a husband. you've done so much more than that. i'm not complaining, but... i thought you wantedto take things slowly. not anymore. i'm here now. out with it. there was never a baby. that took less time than i thought. please can i keep workinghere in the castle? i'll empty chamber pots,i'll muck stalls, anything. oh, stop groveling. as much as it warms me to hear it. i may have other uses for you. - other uses?- i have ladies, technically, they're my friends,none of whom i trust. because they're womenwho sleep with men for a cause. much like you did with the king. only it would be my cause. i promise you'll enjoy it morethan emptying chamber pots. i'm gonna send you toa lady i know in italy. you'll be taught proper manners,and the art of deception. and if you work hard, you may bewelcomed back in the castle as a member of my flying squad. this is where you thank me. thank you, your majesty. uh... that will need fixing, too. my family has owned successfulmines for generations, and i'd always hoped topass that expertise on to my son, but unfortunately,i've had only daughters. take the dumfries mine, it's returned 20 tonsof copper a week for years. a perfect investmentfor a man such as yourself. lord castleroy does quite wellin the spice industry, father. why would he want to invest in minesall the way over in scotland? you can't want me towaste lord castleroy's time explaining things that arebeyond your intelligence. do i have it wrong? i think you do, sir.quite wrong. i think you forget you're no longersimply addressing your daughter, but my future wife. and i'm sorry to say that'snot your first mistake. i've done research on your mines,and dumfries... has been played out for years. much like the rest of your holdings. now, let's look atsome different figures. as part of our marriage settlement,i will provide 10,000 francs to each of greer's sistersto be used as their future dowries. this will allow your daughtersto marry men of title and fortune, making you and your family wealthy. that is what you want, isn't it? uh... there is just one condition. greer will have final approvalover her sisters' marriages, so she can see to it thatthey marry men they love, not those forced on them. why are you doing this? a good businessman always knowswhat something is worth. and to me, greer is priceless. i never meant for youto go to war for me. when are you goingto realize that i love you, and i'll do anything for you? darling, let me be gratefulfor what you've done without making promisesyou can't keep. what you did was extraordinary. i think maybe when i return, you won't be the only onewaiting for me. you're suddenlyvery sure of yourself. i am. but just to be safe. look at me. am i the only one in this bedwith something to forget? what do you mean? when you're with me, i want to be the only oneinside your head. i want you to look into my eyesand see only me. i want you to alwaysremember what i feel like. so when you're using yourfingers for some other task, you wish they weretouching me instead. i will. i want you to always remember whatit feels like to be with your wife. ah, my wife and my son. closest family i have in this world. sharing my castle,my blood, my legacy. why would you lie to me? what do you mean? don't bother addingmore lies to the pile. i know what you've done.you've kept me caged up in this place like one of your song birds. sending in generals to humor me. don't blame mother when you've been hatching plans to attackhalf of europe. they aren't plans anymore! french forces marchedfor calais this morning. they're already halfway there. you think i'm delusional? read these dispatches. they aren't from anyof your performing generals. what happened to general brantome? i've sacked them all.we don't need any generals. not when we have a kingto lead our men. i leave tonight to join the invasion. oh, dear. no trousers. this keeps happening. i realize now that you twowere only trying to protect me. guarding my legacy. but that's my job, not yours. i will not be rememberedas king henry, ruler who dreamed of conquest. i'll be remembered asking henry, conqueror. greatest military strategistsince hannibal. henry, darling, you're not well. i have headaches!you know what else i have? the backing of god. francis, please,talk some sense into your father. it's too late.we can't stop the invasion. and anyway, father's right. what? we can take calais. any fool knows he can't do that. it's true, father's armywould fail on its own. but two armies. one marching head on. the other across this frozen marsh, flanking the english from behind. do you mean the duke's army?mary's army? mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that? my son, making history with me, just like i've always dreamed. i wanted to apologizefor my behavior earlier. i hope i wasn't out of line. it's my father who should beapologizing, though he never would. no one's ever stood up for me likethat before. or for my sisters. i was surprised to see how quietyou acted around your father. i've come to ratherenjoy your usual nature. outspoken, bold. how long have you knownthe truth about us? i've known for some time. as a businessman,i always do my research. but as a gentleman,i wasn't about to bring it up. and as your future husband,you should know i'm... too rich to care. i can't thank you enough. no need to thank me. everyone deserves a chanceto find happiness. just as i have. which brings me to this, i havesomething i'd like you to look over. but promise me you won't sign ituntil you're ready. this is our wedding contract. yes, and since you're now in charge of all marriagecontracts for your family, it means nothingwithout your approval. is something wrong? no, that felt surprisingly right. so you are takingmy mother's last hope, leaving her to the mercy ofthousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown. mary, please understand. i do understand. you're doing what you thinkis best for your country. not only my country. if france is beaten at calais,your country will suffer, too. - france can hardly defend scotland.- defend scotland? when have you ever defended scotland? except with brave words? - that is not fair.- now you want fair? we are rulers, not schoolchildren. blood will be spilled becauseof the choice you have made, - my mother's blood.- you don't know that. but the blood of thousandswould be spilled... - yes, french blood, i know.- i do not only think of france! no, you do not. but you do put her first. as any king would. then can you forgive me? it is myself i cannot forgive. i've made an awful mistake. our marriage was an awful mistake. please don't say that. there were a thousand momentswhere i could've done something. made secret treaties, sold favors, even snuck away to scotlandto be with those people who need me. and do you know why i didn't? because i love you. because i am your wife. mary, listen,when we have taken calais, the first thing i will dois travel to scotland with your uncle's army. we can still save your mother. like when you promised you wouldtake me to scotland with my brother? like when you promised soldiersthe time before that and the time before that? you make it sound like every promisei make is an empty one. what other promise can you make? you are the future king. it's not that simple. maybe it should be. for both of us. what does that mean? nothing. i don't know. i'm only going to asktwo things of you. the first is that youstop making me promises you know in your heartyou can't keep. and the other? come back to me. live through this battle. and don't let england cost me you. forward! have faith, mary.francis is clever and strong. he'll return home safely. i hope so. but even if he survives, our marriage is... what? francis is tryingto save his country, and i can forgive him for that, as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needsto be done for scotland, whatever that may be. what if he can't forgive you? well, that will just be too bad. i won't let him putmy country at risk again. watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[' enjoy all vod in high quality @ 4kvod.tvget live tv,movies,shows in one package gang vs. g-men planning: shigeru okada, tsune yabescreenplay: sakae sajima photography: yoshikazu yamazawasound: koichi iwata lighting: kenzo ginyaart director: hiromu kitagawa music: koichi kawabeeditor: kan suzukiasst. director: mikio koyama production asst.: eiji takedadeveloping\\u00ef\\u00bc\\\\x9atoei chemical industry starring koji tsuruta tatsuo umemiyashinichi chibayoshiko sakuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku spec', \\\"kuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku special joint investigation meeting hey, here they come! chief! what wasthe meeting about?

- what are you investigating?- is tatsumura involved? there are rumors that sanritsuindustries is behind all this. isn't its president tatsumurathe mastermind behind this incident? aren't you flooded with complaints aboutpolice ineffectiveness in the case? they say the authorities are toocautious, or worse, weak-kneed. i'll ask you the same question:what do you guys think? it's easy to criticize others. but are you trying to bring backthe old, heavy-handed police power? it's not as if cautiousinvestigation is bad. and that's part of thedifficulty of this job. it's not you who's been getting yourmen killed at every turn, it's me. oh, hi. the press? yeah. i got a little excited. i went to the farewell ceremonyfor detective sugiyama. i see. well. that's three in a row. - what a shame.- yeah. and...the meeting? it's like we've hit a dead end. we don't have a concrete plan. all the violent incidentsin this neighborhood are connected tosanritsu industries. i'm sure i'm onthe right track, but i don't know where to startto catch them by the tail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 we don't have a single clue. we're helpless. it's our own faultthat the city is calling us weak-kneed. the three men who diedwould turn in their graves. sanritsu industriesbusiness information chairman saichi sakurapresident j\\u00e5\\u00aago tatsumura i just had an idea. i heard a rumor on the street. tatsumura has recently takencomplete control of the organization. they say things are gettingawkward with his uncle, sakura. mmm-hmm... so? if we can crack the organization bysuccessfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get someclues for the investigation. i see. but that would require-- of course.we can't do it alone. we really need the help of a manknowledgeable about the organization. mmm-hmm. a kind of guerrilla operation. interesting idea, but i don't know if there's anybodywho could be that useful. i actually have a littlebit of an idea about that. oh? who is it? tojima brothers hello! hello! coming! oh! old man! hi. hi. welcome. - are you two working together?- no. she wouldn't stop askingme to show her how to fix it. boy, you look terrible! oh! did you have the ceremony yet? no, not yet. it seems rather sillyto call it a wedding now, but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - we'll invite you when we do, mr. ogata.- sure. - please come in.- okay. it looks like two more cars have beenadded after not coming here for a while. but the two drivers are unavailable,so they're just like decorations now. - please have a seat.- okay. hard-working, kind-hearted\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 she'll make a good wife. yeah... i suppose so. so, what broughtyou here today? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 it's kind of hard to saywhat i'm asking you to do. actually, i just wanted to askyou to go back to the old you. - the old me?- yes. a yakuza. old man, don't jokearound with me. i wouldn't joke aboutasking you to do this. please... i really need your help! what's the story? you want me to be a g-man. you're no strangerto tatsumura. i would like to ask you to do this. and let me assure you, this isn't about saving theface of the police or anything. we have to crush that germ-likeorganization as soon as possible. old man, if you want to talk about that,please take it up with someone else. i'm asking because i knowi can count on you. it's not a job thatjust anybody can do. don't give me too much credit. i'm not that respectable. but-- first of all, i don't want to doanything that'll open old wounds. okay. maybe i shouldn't haveasked you to do it. why don't you get outof this business? i'd be happy tohelp you find a job. it would be my pleasure. but i'm a man with no education at all living only for this jobsince i was a simple police officer. the grime sticks anddoesn't seem to come off. i might have to die to get it clean. i'm sorry i can't help you. it's okay. i'll definitelyattend your wedding. yeah. bye. oh? is mr. ogatagoing home already? - yes.- oh. what was that about? it has nothing to do with us. yes, this is tojimatransport co. huh? what's up? it's the usual\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - hello.- how's it going? are you ready toaccept our protection? i refuse. i don't wantto be under your care. think carefully about it. without a driver there wouldn'tbe any business, you know. what? what did he say this time? don't worry about it. huh? the car's back. oof! brother! - osamu!- osamu! what's wrong? he said he gotjumped by thugs. - thugs?- yeah. - let's go inside to treat the wound.- yes. so when did you get out? today. i was on my way here. i was surprised to see that thetruck was marked \\\"tojima transport\\\"! boss, i'm quitting. no matter how many livesi have, it won't be enough. what are you saying? the two guys taking a break musthave gone through the same thing i did. you can't tell usto fight the yakuza. let's do it, bro!i can help you! to be honest, i'm disappointedthat you quit the business. osamu... what have you learnedfrom four years in juvie? i'm not going to fight. i'm going now because they'reprobably waiting for me. you're free to quit. you can take yoursalary up to today. bro! bro! i'm disappointed in you, bro. where's the brotherthat i used to know? i'm sure he wouldn't just sit backand let this happen to him! idiot! damn it! you're not my brother! osamu! don't talk to yourbrother like that. - take care of yourself.- thank you. but, you know, don't youthink it's frustrating? when you'reprovoked like that-- it's frustrating, but we'll be out ofbusiness if we take on every fight. we're not selling fights. but you were the boss's daughter.you should understand how i feel. i've forgotten, you know, the old days. both your brother and i. suit yourself. no wonder my brotherbecame a coward. his wife's too beautifuland too decent. sassy little thing,aren't you? you should look beforeyou say something weird. tojima brothers you see? this business belongsto you and your brother. damn it. my brother, he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 your brother was really lookingforward to you getting out. you have to understand. we're half-brothers. we're not meant to be likeother brothers in the world. what are you talking about? i'll throw you a welcomehome party tonight. what's your favorite thing? what do you want to eat? osamu? osamu!where are you going? who was it? who was it? who did this? - mr. jo.- boss! - this is my car.- what? i parked it on the cornerover there, and it's\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 that's right. why is this happening again? shall i take care of this? mind your own business.leave me alone. don't say that. you need our protection in casethings like this happen. right? - that means you guys are--- boss! anyway, let's go in. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6they've even come toyour business for protection money? if they know the old you, they wouldn'tbe able to do something stupid like that. well, go ahead. sorry. because of my mess,even your store is-- no, actually, my businessis being blackmailed, too. you too, jo? yeah. in the beginningthey called me to invite me. when i refused, the thugs came. i told 'em to look people in the eyewhen talking and threw 'em out. and here we are today. you didn't report itto the police, did you? yeah, i thought about that. but if the cops are there allday long, no customers will come. they predictedthat much, all right. do you know which groupthe thugs belonged to? they belong to the takedafamily down the street. i think sanritsu industries is themastermind behind the protection racket. i heard that thetakeda family's boss became a shareholder ofsanritsu industries the other day. i think that's fishy. i didn't know that. a champion, huh? well, i'm past my prime ifi'm remembering the old days. welcome back! oh... - what happened to your car?- uh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what happened to the drivers? well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 did they all quit? yes. but that's okay.hire someone new again. maybe i should learn to drive. what about tomorrow's work? i turned it down earlier. i'm sure it's not a good time. come on! tonight is osamu'swelcome home party. it's going to beat my apartment. - osamu?- what's wrong? i showed those guys from the takedafamily how strong i got in juvie. idiot! what would you do ifsomething happened to you? worry more about yourselfthan you do about me! - osamu, what happened?- ouch! captain fujikawa washappy that you agreed. we'll help as much as we can. but this work is informal. yes. so it's strange when i'm theone asking you to do this, but - you take good care of yourself and--- old man. you needn't worry about that. i'm willing to do it evenif no one asks me to do it. well, i feel better nowthat you put it that way. and what about your subordinates?

you go live with her.and get a job. that's stupid! please, please don't do it. did you forget whathappened four years ago? didn't you almost die tryingto crawl out of the muck? don't get desperate just becausethings aren't working here. we can go somewherewhere there are no yakuza. please, please don't do it. i'm sorry, but i'vemade up my mind. this time i'm goingto do it my way. that's right!that's right, brother! but you can't do it alone, bro.hey, please, let me do it. i'll bring my friendsif you want. idiot! i said no, you can't do it. pack your bags with her. i've now given youthe gist of it. i'd really like somehelp from you all. i just want to assure you thatwe're subcontracting for the police. it's low-pay despite the risk. i'd like to know if you'restill willing to take it on. please don'thesitate to tell me. when you say subcontracting forthe police, how will you start? first i'll pretend to makea comeback to the yakuza. then i'll infiltrate their organizationunder the guise of a turf war. that would meanwe're the tojima family. gentlemen, this is theperfect role for you. if you look in the mirrori think you'll see what i mean. i don't want to flatter you, buti'd hardly call you all good citizens. but it takes a hell of a lot ofguts and horsepower to hit them. you're all perfect teammembers in that regard. hey, bro, even though it's police work,we're putting our lives on the line. there will be a littlereward, won't there? i can't guarantee that. i'm sure you'llmanage it just fine. but don't forget there'sa policeman next to you. so let's hear your answer. can you guys give me a hand? let's show them what we can do! i'll get tatsumura backfor his protection racket. how about you, matsushima? well, i'm being askedto take care of the car. i don't see anyoneelse qualified. goro? i'll do my best tosave the extra money. mr. policeman? it's my duty soi'll do whatever-- you scared me! - osamu!- brother... don't treat me like a stranger! everyone, i'm hisbrother, osamu kaji. we're actually half-siblings. how many timeshave i told you? i'm not gonnamake you one of us. again with that.i wish you'd trust me. but a goofball like youwould be the first to get hit. i can't take careof a guy like that. well, then, brother.you mean you can't-- you'd be slowing me down.give it up. fine, then!i'll do my own thing! osamu... osamu! he's just like you the way he won'tback out of something once he's said it. he's a real pain in the ass. so everything isokay then, right?

i thought they'dbe here by now. hey. to what do we owethis surprise? it's been a while. how's your shippingcompany doing? i heard you were happy togetherwith the previous boss's daughter. i don't think i can makea living as an honest man. i'm going backto the old tojima. i see. that's why you came allthe way out here to say hello. shimadzu. let's celebratetojima's comeback. book a welcome home party-- you already threw mea welcome home party. a fancy one with lead bullets. i know it was supposedto be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. tojima.... you've become nastierliving as an honest man. i'm not as bad as you. you took over this buildingin less than four years? i was hoping you'd tell mehow to make money. that's the kind of advice one canonly get from a professional. i wish you'd stopwith the innuendos. sanritsu industriesis a legitimate company. and we pay our taxes. if you want, you cango ask the tax office. but i hear there's a lot of money to bemade without the tax office knowing. what do you mean? for example...protection rackets. that sort of workfits these guys. don't move! what's this? a raccoon dog's tail? i'm the one who built all this. i have some allies,but also many enemies. you can never be too careful. everyone, leave us. i think it's time tocut to the chase. i'm being extorted, it seems. no, i just need a little help. it's a lot of work to make upfor four years of absence. i'd like to borrow your territoryfor a while, for old time's sake. sorry, i don't have anythinglike that right now. i have enough to eat running atheater and a recreation center. oh yeah? that's a relief. then i'll make my ownterritory without reservation. that's all well and good,but be careful. they say once a boxer retires,he never makes a comeback again. jinxes can be brokensomeday, you know. well, look forward to it. i see. tojima has shown up so now tatsumura hasmore things to worry about. that's why he tried toget rid of him last night. that was a screw-up,out of character for tatsumura. i'm getting lucky. it's good to live a long time. you've pit the two against eachother for your own advantage? i'm the one who originally createdsanritsu industries, after all. i didn't want to keep it intatsumura's care forever. so... shall we propose the election of a newpresident at the next general meeting? no, i think we'll waitand see what tojima does. - chairman!- hmm? mr. tojima has cometo say hello to you. good thing he came now. have him come over here. mr. chairman,it's been a while. yeah, a while. i hear youmade a comeback the other day. yeah. i'll needyour help again. yeah, sure. but now i'mpractically retired. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 i heard a rumor that you'll be returningas president of sanritsu once again. there are too manyirresponsible rumors out there. i agree. i was even gossipingwith tatsumura just now. with tatsumura? they sayyou had a dispute last night. that's just anotherirresponsible rumor. but you better be careful. it's weird saying thisto your face, i've always preferred youto tatsumura. if you ever need help,i'm always here for you. oh. i'll see you, then. well, i'll leave youalone for today. this is a fine housefor an old fox's nest. and they're even planningto expand the place. sanritsu industries i see. that old manand tojima, huh? i think we can still dosomething about it now. you're something yourself too. what are you after? the sakura family's territory? well, if that's on the table. okay. i'll grant you that. in exchange, get to work. eliminate the old man. boss. he's your blood relative. i don't remember havingan uncle like that. murakami. take the kijima brothers. mr. chairman. these men say that theycame from tatsumura. what do they want? can't you handle it yourself? no, i definitely can't. what are you doing?stop it, you! chairman of sanritsuindustries murdered killing anyone whogets in the way? but this is too much! this is exactly howtatsumura works. now their organizationis strengthened again. we have to find anew way to get inside. welcome. can iget you a drink? i don't have any money.here, let me pay with this. we're supposed to ask for cash. don't be so uptight. i heard whoserestaurant this is. welcome. eh? are you the onei need to talk to? maybe. we'll see. boy, where are you from? check the family register.no comment. well?! i want a clear answer! come this way. here. the pistol. wait here. manager's office i have someonewe could use. we heard your story. - go home for today.- what? we have to check if the gunhas been used in a crime. if you can't tell by holding it,then you're an amateur. what? that gun isn't loaded. you're not qualifiedto be a bouncer. move! are you the boss? if you really want to workhere, do as you're told. waving that thing aroundwon't get you anywhere. got it? got it. nice to meet you. the takeda family controlsthe bar area here. the bars and cabarets in this areaare the yoshi family's territory. both are backed bysanritsu industries, i'm sure. just as i thought. so what's the connection betweentatsumura and the owners? it doesn't seem to bejust protection rackets. i bet they're into somethingmore profitable than that. okay. this istheir turf, anyway. let's provoke them one by one. tojima's taking over this bar.get lost, goons! motherfucker! get him! what the hell, you guys? the tojima family's takingover this place now. if you want protectionmoney, we refuse! what?! - how did you do?- good. ah. now the takedafamily's stronghold. let's all go together. - what's that?- i got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weirdsymbols in the purchase column. let's check thenext place too. go back and tell your boss. tojima is taking overthis business for a while. it'd be interesting tofind a similar ledger. - let's check around.- yeah. somewhere like in here? this is why amateursare no good. leave these thingsto the professionals. it's just beenhigh school so far. now comes the college class. find anything? nothing of value. it's written thesame way as this. what could this mean? i'm sure it has somethingto do with their organization. six people. just six people and they'reraiding turf all over the place. and what do you want me to do? i'm truly ashamed. actually, i'm going totake care of this right now. i just wantedto let you know. in that case,leave him be. let him do histhing for a while. but that's-- don't you get it? what's a couple ofcabarets and bars? the point is to keep ourorganization unnoticed. wait and see what they uncover. sanritsu industries - hey.- huh? so what are they doing? they're not moving at all.the car's crying. we'll let it rest while it can. what the hell is going on? he's wearing a sanritsu badge! who are you calling? oh, it's you, bro! don't scare me! - i was just about to call you--- come here. what the hell is going on here? i used my brain a little. not many people know thatyou and i are brothers, right? because we havedifferent last names. so i figured it was up to me tosneak into tatsumura's place. i told you that you can't. it's too late. i'm in. so you don't wantto hear what i got? you got something? actually, i'm justabout to get it. idiot. you've got me beat. well then, brother! but be careful, you'retalking with the enemy. if you're as careless as youwere just now, you're dead. they're totally systematic. in that organization, unless you're a real old-timer,you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t figure out anything. it seems so. i tried to step on his incomestreams, but it didn't work so well. i'm sure he's got somebig source of money. i'll find it eventually. see you later, brother. all right, place your bets! but think carefullybefore betting. watch closely! here we go. that one. you choose this one? are you sure this is the one? too bad! i feel bad abouttaking from a cop. okay, one more time! we have a visitor. hey, stop. they've been going to barsand cabarets for a while. they don't seem to becollecting laundry. what are they doing? okay, i'll find out. give me a hand. hey, can i get a light? thanks. hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, hey! hey! hey! hey, what do we do? what do we do? good! it's a red light! you stupid bastard,you had me worried. i see. so the dry cleanerwas a collector. yeah. but where is thatmoney coming from? a bag this big witha bunch of bills in it. and instead of laundry,there's a load of whiskey. a daihatsu midget,whiskey, and wads of cash\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 what kind of mystery is this? we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to poke around more. come on. come on. i went to see mr. ogata. i was hoping to askmr. ogata to stop you. and he told me the truth. you should have just told me. am i such an unreliable woman? no. this is my problem. i thought i'd washed my hands of thebusiness, but they don't respect that. i had to do it. to break free. i understand. but this is not just about you. good luck. you're doing a goodthing for the world. but\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 don't overdo it. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i lie in bed, there's a man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i drink wine, there are two men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa when i walk down the street,there are three men \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all stare at me, dead \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa boss, tojima is here. what? okay. i'll check it out. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa the people who loved me \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa they all disappear \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa little red flowers in the heartare hickeys made of lead bullets \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa what's up? are you stillscouting for recruits? not anymore. i found a really good warrior. i think you're inthe wrong place. is that so? i think i read the signproperly and i came in. i think the womanmade a mistake too. aren't you just a kid?don't smoke. what? i've got a lead.i'm counting on it. punch me once. you son of a bitch! what should we do? what's he up to? - let's go.- hold on. wait a little longer. - check the moonshine.- got it. i'll leave that to you. oh, hello! metropolitan police? listen, i'm at the\\\"night castle\\\" cabaret! there are drunks rampaging! yes! please come! - you're saved by the bell.- it's a draw. something extra. i wonder if it'sjust a turf war. no, it can't be. moonshine. this was the key totheir secret organization. so, through the bosses ofthe amusement quarters they would get this moonshineinto bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profitdividends to the shareholders. then this ledger is likely arecord of moonshine sales. i wonder how much moneythey can make on this. if they put import priceson such cheap liquor, they'll make twentytimes as much. - twenty times?- and it's not taxed. compared to that, protectionrackets are nothing. in any case, we're going to find out wherethe moonshine factory is. then we can havethem by the throat. first, let's do all we canto find the couriers. wait a second. what's that? they're collectingempty bottles. so they finally have ajob that looks like a job. that's kind of weird. - what?- those two cars behind us. they've been followingus for a while now. here they come! hey! that's one gone! hey! here they come again! damn it! that was close. good job. hey, matsushima, what's wrong? oh! stupid son of a bitch! why didn't you tell me sooner? this car was entrusted to me.i can't leave it with anyone. you're stubborn! what's wrong? we got shot at while tailingthe bottle collection truck! call a doctor! if it gets in the papers,they're gonna find out. it's no time fortalk like that! wait. lay him down over there. stay sitting. don't just stand there.run hot water. will it work? it didn't work outfor my brother. because it was closeto his vital organs. but it's going tobe okay this time. come on, bite down! harder! hey! he only fainted. it's done. so their focus is nowon the organization. by the looks of it, they'redoing a lot of research. maybe he's a rat for the cops. no way. no way would thecops trust a yakuza. but this needs athorough investigation. if he's willing to go so far, i have an idea too. i came here today to talk toyou on behalf of tatsumura. so now you're going to joinme and take down tatsumura? tatsumura wants to havea peaceful talk with you. i'm gonna usethis for a moment. hello. hey, it's me. yeah, i'mgiving him the phone now. it's tatsumura. hello. tojiima? it's me. i don't have anything totalk to you about now. you might not, but i do. say, would you like tohear a pretty woman's voice? what? would you liketo say something? she doesn't seem tohave anything to say. but you're not an idiot. so i'm sure you'llback off quietly. don't give in! all you've donewill be for nothing! akiko! don't worry about me! don't back off for a second! akiko! stop! got it now?

heh-heh. well\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 - sis!- don't move! sorry about last night. i didn't mean tomake things worse. i just thought our discussion mightgo better with a woman involved. well, have a seat. we're not supposed to sitdown and talk to each other. i see. well, let's hear youranswer right away. you'll back off,of course, right? i'm not backing off yet. oh... i guess we had it all wrong. we thought you hada thing for that woman. so you don't carewhat happens to her? i'd like to ask yousomething first. do you have the guts tomake a suicide pact with me? a suicide pact? yeah. you wouldn't have the guts. because you havetoo many things. you ruined my business. and you even kidnapped akiko. thanks to you, i'm reallynaked. i have nothing to lose. not even my life. if anything happens to akiko,you can be sure i'll kill you. if you think being surrounded byguns will stop me, you're wrong. i swear i'll get it done. how about it? shall i try it right now? if you don't have the guts,return akiko immediately. then you can fight me. are you so rotten thatyou can't even do that? boss, i know who the spy is. who is it? it's that bastard kaji. he didn't see me and i caughthim trying to save the girl. i tied him up and threwhim in the basement. i see\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 so he was the cop's dog. or was he your dog? i guess that was astupid question to ask. let's ask kaji himself. show our guest the way. so you're a dirty rat andyou had me fooled, too. i'd like to knowwho asked you to do it. i just felt sorry for the girl,so i decided to let her go. i'll make you wishthat you'd talked. - idiot!- bastard! idiot! it's useless to beat me up. useless, huh?

guess he forgot i once refusedto give his daughter an a. do the world a favor;don't remind him of that. now, that is a secure line, so that we can, you know, talkwithout any borises listening in. just in case you have trouble stayingwarm on those long winter nights. - i was not sleeping!- you were! - i was meditating.- you were snoring in the middle of... - i was not. was i?- yes! but you find thatincredibly sexy though. - snoring!- come on, it's not an old thing! - it was a... it was a boring movie.- no. come on, i'm so with it.look, come on. look at my phone. look at all theapplications and life hacks i have here. life hacks! - whoa.- what?

i already told you, we datedfor three weeks when i was your age. we are just friends.but it is really important to me that he feels like i am someonethat he can trust. - please be more mysterious.- look, i don't want him thinking that i'm going around telling peoplethat i'm \\\"one half of starrison.\\\" and according to this,not the cute half. girls, i'm leaving. come say do svidaniya. let's go say do svidaniya. - morning, all.- morning. nadine tells mei have a very full schedule today. starting with the russian war gamesoff the alaskan coast. they began this morning. a flotilla ofsome 50 different vessels and aircraft. they're technically within their rights. the maneuvers and test firings aretaking place outside american airspace. still insultingly closeto our northern borders. we were expecting something like this.after the nato thing? yes, it's believed to be a responseto our announced deployment of the natorapid response strike force in latvia. which was our response to russia'smeddling in its neighbors' affairs. moldova being the most recent example. white house expects usto send a d\\u00e3\\u00a9marche, a diplomatic cable in protest. the nato force in latviawas the right call. i'm just annoyed that ostrov isso determined to refight the cold war, instead of fixing his crappy economy. don't put that in the protest thingy. speaking of the cold war, there's a ceremony todayfor ezra lyle helsinger, the department'soldest foreign service officer. he's retiring todayafter 60 years of service. wow. 60 years? good for him. i'm sorry. ma'am?you're needed in the situation room. elizabeth. what's up?blake couldn't give me any details. - that's because it's need to know.- ok, what do i need to know? russian war games have gotten heated. one of their subs split from the fleetand crossed into us coastal waters. not unprecedented. russians like to test our defenses,like we test theirs. but we were tracking the suband it vanished. that is unprecedented. so they've perfectedsome kind of cloaking technology. and the sub's nuclear armed. it's somewhere off the alaska shoreline,intentions unknown. could be posturing.could be about to start world war iii. - what's ostrov saying?- we tried calling. we're told he's at a remote location.he can't be reached. so he's vanished. heck of a weekfor henry to go to russia. can't disagree with you there. thank you. professor mccord,you are most welcome. - thank you, minister gorev.- you must call me anton. even after i wouldn't giveyour daughter an a? i overreached in asking.an \\\"incomplete\\\" was generous. well, good.i'm glad we cleared the air on that. as am i. indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetingsbetween our militaries. to keep the air clear. especially in a timeof such unfortunate misunderstandings. thank you very much.it's an honor to be here. i'm gonna speak with you todayabout a subject that is of great importance to our twocountries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfareor struggle. namely, jihad in classical islam and in both eastern and westernchristianity, the concept of crusade. professor mccord, may i introducethe president of the russian federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,pavel ostrov? professor mccord,it is an honor to meet you. it's also my honor, mr president,and a bit of a surprise. i like to come to this placeon occasion for a visit. for the beautiful country,the recreation and for the game. i'm told you enjoy blood sports. if, by that, you mean hunting, then, yes, my father took me sometimes. deer, duck, an occasional squirrel. then you must come hunt with me.no refusing. my pleasure is to showthe goodness of russian life to such eminent, distinguished guest. with such a beautiful, eminent wife. mr president, we've been in contact.they deny that sub is even there. still claiming their rightto refute reality. what do we know about the sub itself? we think it's the yalta, sir.it's a new sub out of vladivostok with experimental stealth technologymore advanced than ours. - apparently.- it's powered by a fission reactor, carrying six bulava-typecruise missiles, each with 150-kiloton warheadand a range of about 60 miles. but again,what is most disturbing about it... besides the fact that it could beon its way to flatten anchorage. is how they have just proven that they can evadeall forms of detection by sonar, magnetic anomalyor satellite array. a true stealth weapon. they can hit usbefore we even know they're there. ostrov's been bankrupting his economy, trying to get back to military paritywith the west. - now he may have it.- they've got the drop on us. what do they want? is ostrov just making us sweator is this more than posturing? sir, if ostrov isn't talking to us,i may know somebody who will. nadine, can you clear my schedulefor the rest of the day? - all of it, ma'am?- and, nadine, quietly, ok? - get gorev on sivits, please.- yes, ma'am. is everything ok, ma'am? yeah, it's fine.i just need to clear my schedule. it's definitely a loose nuke.we're all dead. there's a bunker in the basement. ok, that's enough doomsday.you heard the secretary. let's clear her schedule. quietly. - she's fun!- i heard that. don't try and evade the issue and don't try telling methat this sub isn't there. anton. it's just the two of us now. yes, two friendstalking openly and honestly, but friends also don't put powerfulweapons on each other's borders. hmm. i'm listening.i thought it might come to this. so, say one of our subsdid lose its direction and come too close to your alaskawith its bears and salmon. you're about to put nato troopson the latvian border, just a few hundred miles from moscow. which is less friendly? - so, what can we do about that?- cancel the nato deployment and perhaps the captainwill find his map again. come back home.honest enough for you? perfectly. you also know i'm being honest wheni tell you that bullying and threats will not alter the resolveof the united states or its allies. and your presidentneeds to pick up the phone. i will tell him myself when i see him.he can't have gone far. - what are you talking about?- didn't you know? president ostrov has invited yourhusband henry to go hunting with him. they're in the woods, hunting grouse. one of president ostrov'sfavorite pastimes. it's quite an honor for your husband. is that what it is? i'm certain they're havinga wonderful time. well, all i can say is...they better be. until later, madam secretary. sorry. hunt requires quiet, professor. we are not having very much luck today. maybe the camera crewhave something to do with it. i don't understand. with this gun,i always have very good luck. - oh, it's beautiful.- my grandfather's. he kept it with him in the greatpatriotic war, your world war ii, during the blockade leningrad. - the siege of leningrad?- you know it? yes, of course. through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cockedand loaded by the front door, so if the germans ever break through, if they come to the housefor my aunts and my grandmother, he has somethingto shoot the enemy with. and if necessary...his family and then himself. may i ask, sir,why you're telling me all this? our peopleare never frightened, professor, and we outlast our enemy. so, tell your wife and your president,we don't back down. i will convey your message,mr president. but to be honest, i have no ideawhat you're talking about. don't worry. they will. he did what? yeah.my left ear is still ringing. now i know what that was all about.he was using me for propaganda. let's just hope that's all you are. - you think he'd take me hostage?- i don't know. clearly, he coordinatedthe sub incursion with your visit. it's just optics. lecturingthe secretary of state's husband while his sub is sneaking around alaska? the message is,don't let nato troops go into latvia. well, now that we've heard it,why don't you come home? no, if i cut and run now,he'll just know that we're scared. i should act like everything is fine. they've invited me to touran orthodox monastery of st george. i think i should go. besides,it's a significant historical site, crucial to the spread of christianityduring mongol rule. i am finding your dorkinessoddly reassuring right now. we need you in there. henry, i gotta go. - be safe, ok?- i will. ok. henry alright? as long as the only actual shotsbeing fired are at a bunch of defenseless birds,yeah, i think we're alright. this is ostrov grandstanding.clearly, the man likes to put on a show. what do you propose? if he wants to grandstand,hide and seek with the sub, and whatever he's trying to dowith the secretary's husband, we should put on a show right back. not only mobilizethe strike force to latvia, but deploy the sixth fleet's flagshipto the black sea. turkey will allow it,but it's posturing. it's us doing exactly what ostrovis doing, only bigger and louder. surest sign of strengthis to show you are able to use it. but are we willing to use it, sir? i think we just got a signalthrough your husband, bess. all this russian presidenttruly understands or respects is force. - give the order to move the fleet.- yes, sir. we've cleared the secretary's schedule,but one item's proving tricky. - and that is?- ezra helsinger's retirement ceremony. she's expected to give a speechor at least make an appearance. - today's his last day.- he's a living legend. everyone's gonna be there,including press. m-sec doesn't show, there'll be rumors. i'll let her know. keep it on for now. speaking of rumors, i'm hearingthe pentagon's parking lot is hopping. people coming in insteadof going home? never a good sign. yup, we're all about to be fraggedby a fiery ball of death. it was nice to know you. daisy, something you should see. you know the secretary'sso protective of the family? \\\"let them say what they will about me, so long as they leavethe kids out of it?\\\" the kids are not out of it. well, the secretary'snot gonna love this, but it just looks likeyour typical internet rumors. daisy, you have a phone call. - it's the secretary's daughter.- or not. she's at the mouth of glacier bay, resting on a seabedin 100 meters of water. within the 12-mile limit. a violationof our territorial sovereignty. aerial recon detected a burstof very low-frequency transmission. they're fairly certainthey were attempting to communicatewith their command vessel. since then, nothing. no distress signal, no response toour radio transmissions or hydrophone. ostrov still isn't picking up his phone.what's his game, bess? trying to back us out of latviai thought. but to be honest, at this moment, sir,i don't know. is there an optic cableburied along that coast? land-linked to our anti-missiletracking stations up north. so, it could be a spy missiontrying to tap that cable. yes, and it hassix nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying juno55 miles down that channel! it could be awaiting orders! if they wanted to nuke us,they have icbms that could obliterate new yorkin 20 minutes. why park a sub off of alaska? juno would be gone in 30 seconds. and then the sub would disappeardown the coast to seattle, la. how longbefore we can physically engage? you mean threaten it, sir?capture it and report it? i mean destroy it. sir, our closest surface vesselis the navy minesweeper kirkland. it can be at the site within 90 minutes. tell the russians they have two hours. two hours for that sub to be goneor we take it out ourselves, by whatever means necessary. which the russianswill view as an act of war. and this isn't? can't say we didn't warn them. sorry i'm late. so, we're gonna pay tribute tomr helsinger just like nothing's wrong. yes, ma'am. is anything wrong? uh, nothing we're talking about. ma'am, your speechdoesn't need to be formal. just a few unrehearsed,off-the-cuff remarks. and here they are. great. six decades of service in germany,eastern europe and the middle east, a crewman for a vanderbilt yacht and a writer for timeand the paris review. ezra, you truly are a witness to and a creator ofwhat your first boss, henry luce, called \\\"the american century.\\\" thank you. enjoy your life. and have some cake! yeah, sure, sure. oh, please, don't get up, ezra. i'm very sorry.i was supposed to bring you your gift. but we're a little disorganized today. there's no need to apologize, ma'am.the threat of war with the russians? that's apt to frazzle a person. and on the very daythat the last of the cold warriors shuffles off to buffalo too.how's that for irony? has someone been telling you things? i have seen this movie before,madam secretary. the russian navy holding war gamesin the bering sea. i... i happened to see a little itemon the dod daily rundown this morning. we are sending a naval flagshipinto the black sea. ostrov is posturing on russian tv. and with your husband, no less. he's a handsome fella, by the way. you've cleared your calendar. except for those eventswhere your absence would be noticed. you really do knowhow to read the signs. now, tell that to the dmv.they took my damn license! you still work for me, for the nextseveral hours anyway, right? um... yeah. till five o'clock. so, there's this invisible submarine,a super weapon, it's just sitting there,letting us look at it. right! i was wondering about that too. i mean, why turn offthe stealth technology? well, back in my day, we only tried to readthe russians' intentions. their mentality. to look at the chess playeras well as the pieces on the board. well, that's sort of tough since ostrovwon't even admit there's a game. not even talking. but see,that in itself tells us something. i mean, he's a bully and a poser, right? well, the question iswhy isn't he bragging? throwing this in our face? right... right. why... why not tell the russian public or the whole world, for that matter, that he snuck advanced technology inright under our noses? beat us at our own game. in our backyard. and you're right. you know,it isn't like ostrov to hold back. unless there's somethinghe didn't count on. - something went wrong.- hm-hmm. that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. and again... ostrovwould never admit that, would he? makes you wish it was him sitting herenow instead of me, doesn't it, so you could ask him? you do knowthere's no smoking in here? hm-hmm. oh, yeah, yeah. an ordinance against smokingin this building since 1997, i think. i miss the war. i, too, have great respectfor st nicholas. stop filming.what are you doing here, henry? your tour of the church is over. i mean, st george is great.the warrior saint. the victor. but st nick represents compassion. he's the one you turn towhen times are tough. of course,we've trivialized him in the west, made him into the precursorof our modern-day santa claus. what is your point? thought that maybewe would light a candle together. i don't think so. i'm in no need of miracles.you may be. not me. so, we clear? no more pictures.nothing personal. - no posting where others can see.- and? absolutely nothing involvingthe first family or the white house. - thank you.- ok, then, leave it to me. i'll see what i can do to keep majornews outlets from picking up the story. - without telling mom?- yeah, no. it'll all be fine.besides, the best defense is the truth. and since you and harrisonaren't actually an item... you'd tell me if you were, right?honestly, he is kind of cute. - i mean, i'd understand.- no, i have a boyfriend, ok? - oh, yeah? who's that?- it's just this guy that i work with. another internfrom the microloan program? - uh...- wait, what's with the face? are you, like, dating your bossor something? oh, my god.wait, are you dating arthur gilroy? - yeah. look, i know it sounds...- stevie, no. forget harrison.now we have a problem. mom and dad are fine with it. sort of. they may be fine as parents,but from a press perspective, looking at damage control? there are three wordsthat can never go together in this town, and that is \\\"boss,\\\" \\\"intern\\\" and \\\"sex.\\\" - you've gotta end it. now.- what? why? what do you think will happen whenit comes out about you two? and it will. i will deal with it. the microloan programwas on the chopping block. people would loveto get back at your mother. they'd happily throw arthur gilroyonto the fire to do that. you really thinkthat's what will happen? i know it will. this is st nicholas we're talking about?as in kris kringle? he means something morein orthodox tradition. he's the one you turn toin cases of calamity, when things have turned against you. just an observation,but he seemed like a different person. like he was afraid, even. - afraid of what?- i don't know. but i know when true believersare really praying, and ostrov was. the guy that took me huntingthis afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way. could something have happenedto change that? as a matter of fact, something did. henry, i gotta take thisto the president. if ostrov is scared, it may bebecause he's lost control of that sub. you think he could overreact? that or we will. - at this point, it's academic.- wait. the deadline isn't up yet! i'm overriding it.we've got the russians' response. two battle cruisersand three sister attack subs are on a direct course to glacier bay. carrier strike group is on its way to intercept. the sub hasn't budged. the kirkland's stationed over it, aboutto commence dropping depth charges. why? standard naval etiquette. you don't surrender,we force you to surface. the kirkland.we are directly above the target. we are about to drop depth charges. three, two, one. standing by.something's happening. fish in the water.target has launched a torpedo. initiating countermeasures. we are hit.repeat, the kirkland has been hit. sir, we've lost communicationwith the kirkland. carrier strike group has re-establishedcontact with the kirkland. - damage assessment?- injuries. so far, no fatalities. a visual from a medi-chopper.ship is under power, headed for port. norad reports a squadron of russianmig-35s just performed a flyover. - saw the kirkland take the hit.- damn it! i've got northcom and thecommander of the us pacific fleet requesting immediate authorityto engage. a communiqu\\u00e3\\u00a9 from the russians.their vessel was defending itself. any further attack will be met withquote \\\"overwhelming retaliatory force.\\\" without getting into specifics. call their bluff, sir.they're guilty of an act of war. all due respect,we don't know who's guilty of what. i'm just saying, mr president,before we declare war, let's determine exactlywho we're going to war with. what if that sub hasn't movedbecause it's incapable of moving? what if something went wrong? that sub isn't doingwhat it's supposed to. the captain and crewcould be operating without orders, off the chain of command of the kremlinand his president. what does it matter?we respond to actions, not intentions. we do not let an attackon american lives go unanswered. and we don't go to war over a mistake! outside. ostrov lost control of the yaltabecause your husband knows religion and he saw ostrov ask santa for a wish? the secretary's husband has shownhe can be a pretty effective operative, as well as a religious scholar. well, what if i trust your analysis? say ostrov is scared, operatingin the blind, like we all are here. - then what?- we don't push him to the brink. not until we know more. every second we waitlets those battleships get closer or lets the sub fire another missileor six of them, all of them nukes. if we hit it with one of ours,it's got a 10k reactor on board. we risk sending a radioactive tsunamidown the channel... that'll make fukushima a fond memory.i get it, bess. so, what do you propose? we have to take one last chanceand try and talk to that submarine. directly and without moscow knowing. there has to be a way. that's the unmanned submersible.if the russian crew gets a visual, they'll know it's harmless,incapable of attack. we're tapping on their hull. we're using the retractable armto tap out a message. - morse code.- old school, but it works. we're asking them to statetheir name, mission, allow us on board. that's them answering. there's activity. one of her torpedo tubesis opening, flooding. she's gonna fire. no. it's her distress buoy. they're asking for help. stephanie! are you and harrison dalton dating?is he a good kisser? stephanie, is it true?are you and harrison dalton dating? hey, you ok? yeah, i'm not used to being ambushed. yeah, you've had a lot of pings. you're gettingsome serious unwanted attention. yeah, they were outside my house.and then on the street. it's crazy. don't worry. you and harrison are justfilling bandwidth between kardashians. it's gonna blow over soon.none of this matters. listen to me, what matters is our work. right? the microloans program,that's what matters. yeah, about that... hey, you're not quitting, are you? oh, you're quitting this. us. both. i'm quitting... i'm quitting both. look, once they figure outthat i'm not dating harrison, they're going to figure outwho i am dating. so what? you really wanna throw awayyour whole career on some intern? i know i've harped on this a lot,but i have been around, ok? just let me... let me worry about that. look, ok, you know what?you're too old. you're too old and it's not gonna work. is that what you need to hear? uh, ok. ok. it's been really nice working with you. listen to me, do you really wanna losewhat means so much to you? please, just take a few daysand think about the job, not me. the job. ok. i have to go. see you around, kid. see you around, old man. he's the executive officerof the russian submarine, the yalta. they're transmitting from the bridge. they have an antennaattached to their distress buoy. they suffered a malfunctionwhen the new technology failed. there was a fire in the control room.they couldn't contain it. a loss of oxygen. 42 crew members have already died. that's two-thirds of their crew. the captain broke radio silenceto report it. we received instructions. do not signal for help. do not allow the americans to board. if you can't restore power,then destroy the sub and all evidenceof new deflector technology. anything to keep usfrom getting our hands on it. ask why they fired the torpedo. the captain panicked. he thought they were being attacked. the captain's no longer in commandof the vessel. nice way of saying they mutinied. we only have two hours of oxygen left.we're asking for your help. please help us. please... help us. the russian battle cruiserhas reached our line of quarantine. we tell the russians we're gettingthose men out, they'll refuse. they're close enoughto send out a missile and destroy it themselvesbefore we touch it. so, no good options. ostrov will never admit failure or concedethat one of his crews mutinied. not in public. there may be a way to resolve this. a deal that even he can live with. butwe need to go through back channels. and we happen to have one. we do. it's an interesting offer. president dalton will confirm it's real.you can call him directly. i'm sure it's genuine,but i wonder if there are alternatives. the alternative is a returnto the days of the cold war, sir. there was a time whenour two countries, our two grandfathers, fought on the same side. mine survived a siege too. bastogne. the battle of the bulge. at the end of the war, he exchanged cigaretteswith russian soldiers on the elbe river. traveling here, i thought of him.he would've been happy. he knew first-handwhat our countries could accomplish when they work togetherfor the common good. i wear this in honor of mine. - st nicholas.- my grandfather's name saint. nikolai is an old family name. he, too, may have been happyto see us here in peace. perhaps this iswhat he sacrificed so much for. i will call your president. the fire occurred on the yaltaafter an accidental nighttime collision between the russiannuclear-powered submarine and the us minesweeper kirkland. the disabled sub then driftedinto american territorial waters where us naval personnel boarded itin an attempted rescue. tragically, they found no survivors. - crew members will be buried at sea.- poor guys. what a way to go. i'm just glad that thingsdidn't escalate with russia. - look who i brought.- mr helsinger. - we thought you'd left.- your tour of duty ended yesterday. well, i figured one more daywouldn't matter. also, they told mei still had to pick up my gift. oh, yes, the secretarywanted to give that to you personally. it'll just be a few more minutes. i'll wait. getting used to that, waiting. oh, yeah. interestinghow all that turned out, isn't it? - very sad story.- uh-huh. but defense is handling it.we had nothing to do with it. still, it is very interesting. and it is a story. kind of makes you wonderwhat really happened. hmm. these are all of them? all 20 survivors of the yalta.a few hours ago. being given a top-secretand strictly classified welcome aboard the uss teddy roosevelt. the russians will be announcing thattheir remains have been buried at sea. so we'll leave it to themto make sure the story holds up. as you said,they are good at refuting reality. - ostrov accepted the deal?- yes, sir. they'll all get new lives andidentities, here in the united states. the price for letting us rescue them.unbelievable. in all fairness, sir, we did geta chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealthtechnology before giving it back. at least those poor bastardswon't get sent home and shot for mutiny. but they will never seetheir families again. not even to let them knowthat they're alive. any contactputs their loved ones in danger. all so that ostrovcould save face. hell of a thing. sir, the nato forcesare still deploying to latvia and the yalta situationdidn't spiral out of control. - we won this round.- yeah. the world did not blow up on our watch. for at least another day or two. probably my first day on the job. i could not believei was meeting the old man. - whoa. is that john foster dulles?- yeah. the architect of permanent peacein europe. stood up to soviet aggression. that picture was taken the day presidenteisenhower and secretary dulles signed the treatybringing germany into nato. he always said that,\\\"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the...\\\" \\\"the necessary art.\\\" would you guys give us a minute? - congratulations, sir.- thank you. - a pleasure.- mine. i never even asked youwhere you were going. oh, um... prague. budapest, berlin. you ever thinkyou'd live to see the day when the wall came down,open borders, free elections? sometimes we wondered if we'd liveto see the next five minutes. but somehow we understoodthat if we just kept talking... in the end, the sovietsdidn't want to push that button any more than we did. there was a... a rationality to it,crazy as it seems. mutually assured destruction. yeah, but your new enemies today,they have no such qualms. they wanna push that buttonand there's no holding them back. that's a bit grim, isn't it? i don't know. makes me feel naive for being hopeful. oh, you'll be fine. i've seen a lot of them come and go. i think you're the one for the job. - ezra.- madam secretary. you and i should keep talking. well, for what it's worth,ali feels terrible about \\\"starrison.\\\" i know she does. it's ok. and i'm sorry about \\\"starthur.\\\" let's not go crazy with the names. i think that you did a very adult thing. but i know it was hardand i'm so sorry that you're hurting. - come here.- thanks. - sweetie.- well, at least dad will be overjoyed. but he'll hide it well,which is all you can ask for. hm-hmm. this is nice, by the way. you going to an event tonight? i am. the mccord family dinner.soon as dad gets back. oh. yeah, i don't... i don't knowif i'm up for that. well, get up for it. we're celebrating. - why?- because we can. because we're here. dad's home! come on! get your coats. we founda place with awesome vegan options. - i did.- that's nice. listen, i just want you to knowthat even when it's hard and no matterhow much it hurts right now, it is not the end of the world, ok? where are they? here they are. i missed you guys. what do you think? - oh, i think it's awful.- hi. hi. oh, mom texted me. i'm so sorry, honey. - nice try, dad.- i mean it, honey. - hey...- come on. let's get some food, please. - let's go, guys.- wait. let me just get my coat. - dad, can i wear the hat?- no. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from  \",\n          \"\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bf \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:   previously on reign: lord castleroy. i know i'm notthe man of your dreams. will you accept my humble proposal?

he might be understanding. tell a suitor we're broke?my father would have a heart attack. i've had more opportunitiesthan you can count. and what do i do? fall in love with a servantand nearly ruin his life, too. we've all had the same opportunity,and look at us. i never dreamt that i'd be wed toa bastard with an imaginary title. lola's been forced to hide herpregnancy. even mary and francis... yes, when we couldn't cometo terms on my brother, my beloved husbandlocked me in a tower. it's been almost a month. are you and francison any better terms? well, i can now talkto him without screaming. does that count as \\\"better\\\"? your majesty?i have dire news from scotland. it's about your mother,marie de guise. the protestants and theirlords of the congregation have sent an army to besiegemy mother in edinburgh. there are men outside thecastle demanding her surrender. her friends don't know how muchlonger she can hold out for. mary, i'm so sorry. my brother james warnedus that the protestants were planning a rebellionagainst my mother. if i had gone with him,i could have stopped it. or you could've been killed. this news only proves it. it's too badwe couldn't protect my mother by locking her in thetower as you did with me. instead of arguing,let's help her. your mother needs soldiersand quickly. and how are we supposed to get them?certainly not from your father. armies can be bought. who has that kind of money? my mother. francis, i've already askedyour mother. more than once. - she's always said no.- then we will ask her together. and we will keep askinguntil she says yes. mother, we need to talk. i realize that.why do you think i sent for you two? oh, you sent for us?so you've heard the news then? i'm sorry, mary.you must be crushed. well, i'm worried, i'm not crushed. there's still timeto send reinforcements. oh, dear. i don't think we'retalking about the same news. have you not heardabout the succession? whose succession? not yours, i'm afraid. word came from england.it's official. elizabeth will be their next queen. - mary tudor's dead?- no! the old bitch is stillclinging to her miserable life. but she managed to cough up the gallto hand over her crown to elizabeth. a bastard, a protestant no less,and not my son's wife! are you even pregnant yet? could you possibly beany less use to france? do not talk to my wife that way.she's a queen and an ally. she was supposed to get me england! we've been feedingand housing this ally for most of her pointless life.and what have we gotten? a drain on our treasure and army, an endless paradeof dramas and headaches. scotland protects france by engagingthe english on two fronts so it cannot focus its forceon growing its foothold on your backyard, calais. i don't need a lecturefrom you on geography. scotland cannot bluntthe english threat alone, your grace. - especially not now!- yes, i've heard all about it. protestants threatening your mother.she needs reinforcements - just like always.- no, not just like always. she is under siege.there are soldiers at her gates! and now you're afraidyour poor mother might die? well, don't we owe itto scotland and france, as rulers, to ask if thatmight be a good thing? your mother can't handlethe job that you gave her. or else she wouldn't be under siege! father, stop this. mary's crown is at stake,which puts france at risk as well. more than her crown is at stake. your mother failed us completely. and now they wanther head on a pike. be careful. or yours might follow. no one? not one country or lord offers help? my mother is a catholic ally. she is under attack. enemies screaming for her head,and no one cares? scotland has many friends at court. but every conversation i have with anoble or diplomat ends the same way. \\\"we're with you, dauphin,but what does the king say?\\\" i hope you didn't tell them. mary, i should neverhave let my father... words don't bother me. you are safe in this castle. - not even my mother...- threats don't bother me, either. losing bothers me. - mary, that's silly, you're...- a queen? yes, i am. but one with scant power here. and less every day back home. on the other hand, i'm also queenbecause i'm a de guise. i have very powerful uncles. i hope you're not thinking... my mother is surroundedon all sides. protestants are burningand pillaging catholic churches. why would they stop theircampaign of destruction before making sure i losemy mother and my crown? but the duke of guise? ever since you've been back at court, you've chosento keep your distance from him. the same as my parents have. your uncle is a dangerouslyambitious man, who has built himself an army bystealing recruits from their mothers. and paying them well. do you know anyone elsewith an army as large or as loyal? loyal to him. and him only. is that someone that you can trust? he is my uncle. if that doesn't buy mehis loyalty, well... trust is a luxuryi can no longer afford. sorry, you're not to be letin under any circumstances. do you know who i am? you're the contest winnerthe king enjoyed. and then cast aside. penelope, what are you doing here? surely a bounty of demeaning tasksawaits you in the kitchen. - i need to see the king immediately.- hmm. i'm pregnant. with his child. you're not pregnant. even if you are,it's not with the king's child. well, the king will want to know. he's going to wonder if he's gotanother chance at happiness. another chance at a childhe could truly love! shut her up now. henry, i love you and i miss you!and i'm carrying your child! you're pregnant? you're certain it's my child? there's been no one else,your majesty. - i was a maiden when you took me.- oh, that's nonsense. see that she's taken care of. set her up with a cottagein one of the villages. oh! i have some mistresses. in bernay, i think. the child could havesiblings to play with, huh? wait. that's all i get? henry! it's more than you deserve. are you sure you wantto be playing this game? if you overplay it, if he losespatience with your displays, you won't like how it ends. the two dead girls before you didn't. nothing bothers me more than problemsi've already solved coming back to be problems again. if that's what you makeof yourself, my child, expect me to make youa lesson to my other problems by grinding you into the dustyou no longer see fit to sweep. oh-oh-oh!oh, i've missed you two so much! father. where's mother? she's at homewith your other sisters. i've only brought these twoso you could introduce them to potential suitors. aren't they a little youngto be looking for husbands? considering all thetrouble we've had with you, i regret not bringing them sooner. and i hope you haven't made toolarge a mess for me to clean up. i realize i made a mistake, but it'snot as bad as you may have heard. no? tell me, will there be any surprises for lord castleroyon your wedding night? anything he can accuse you of later? no, it didn't go that far. does that embarrass you? then imagine howit embarrassed the family. i may sound harsh,but it's for your own good. you can't affordto lose another suitor. do i have it wrong? no, father. i stopped by our new houseon the way back. it needs workbefore we can live there. especially if we want tobring it to your standards. bash, that's lovely,but what happened out there? you've been outin those woods for weeks hunting that creature.have you found it yet? the darkness? no sign of it yet,but it's only a matter of time. the blood wood is vast,but not limitless. have you been all right? i hope there haven't beenany more encounters with the king. i've been staying out of his way. waiting for you to return. why do you stop? it's not our first kiss.you're my husband, it's all right. it's not as though i'm inexperienced. i'm well aware of that. well, if you wanted a virgin... no, i don't.but i care about your experience. i know not all of it has been good. there's no changing that now. i disagree. what are you doing? helping you forget everythingand everyone that's come before this. tell me what you want... very specifically.leave nothing out. all right. do you have any ideawhat you've done? francis, you should havetalked her out of this madness. you should have helped her. i know you're a student of history. perhaps you missed this chapter: the duke was dismissedfrom your father's court for grasping at too much power. and you know what he did then? he fielded that armyto grasp at more. he's a vicious self-serving killer,a threat to any throne. coming from you,that's a ringing endorsement. i wouldn't be so smug, my dear. you just let the devil into our home. thank you so much for coming, uncle. we wish it was underbetter circumstances. like your wedding, perhaps? i seem to have missed my invitationto that happy event, your grace. the wedding was very rushed.i hope you took no offense. nonsense. don't troubleyourself over niceties. i don't. dauphin. the king and queensend their regards. they regretnot greeting you personally, but urgent mattersdemand their attention. you don't have to make excuses. i'm aware of your parents'opinion of me. and from what i hear,even when your father is present, the king is no longer in the castle. i don't know what rumorsyou've heard, sir, but... call me christian,and let's spare ourselves lots of pointless formalityand posturing. i have friends who tell mewhat goes on in this castle. i know why you asked for me, and i'm here toget you out of the hole my sister's incompetence put you in. very well, no posturing. my mother is in danger,but i'm guessing that it will take more thanfamily loyalty to buy your help. so what will it be? money? land? neither. your father dismissedme from court years ago. i want a position in court again. a more permanent one. lord magistrate of france will do. the lord magistrateis the king's right hand. you want a better position thanthe one that you were stripped of after you challenged your king? i didn't challenge my king,i served him. by appointing generalswithout his permission and doling out political patronageto your friends? while your father was busy producingheirs, bastards and otherwise, he needed my help,whether he cared to admit it or not. he needed your loyalty, whetheryou cared to provide it or not. i can make your army serveme for nothing if i wanted. i have that authority. they're right outsideif you'd like to try. i just don't know how many will stillbe around tomorrow if i'm not. they're loyalto the man who pays them, not the boy who waves crowns at them. we'll consider the termsand present them to henry. uncle. your father will never agree. he has to. or you'll lose scotland,and so will we. hurry up!i mean, i want you and everything, but we must be quick. what's the meaning of this? sorry, your majesty, i was just... i know what you were just,you vile little man. have you no decency? laying your handson a favorite of your king? leave, before i have youthrown in the dungeon! i hope he didn't hurt you. - no.- i got here just in time, didn't i? if that man had had his way, he'd be able to claimyour unborn child, and where would thatleave you with the king? i'm already pregnant.my child is the king's. then i'm sure you'll agreeit's not just yourself that you need to protect anymore. the life of the king'sunborn baby is at stake. we simply can't risk that. you need to go somewhere safe. the king will be outragedwhen he finds out you're locking meand his baby in here. no, the king will be outragedwhen \\\"his\\\" baby comes out looking more likeone of his stable boys. or, more likely,no baby comes out at all. neither of those things will happen. enjoy your solitude, my dear. i'll drop by every month or so to share in the joy ofwatching your belly grow. wait! don't leave me here! a word of advicefrom someone who knows: don't make friends with the rats.they bite. wait, wait. greer tells me her sisters havenever been to a castle before. i say we give them the royal tour. that can wait. i'd like to discuss the matterof greer's dowry as soon as possible. now? in front of your daughters? we don't need to discussgreer's dowry. i've given the matter some thought,and i'm not interested. not interested? then what is it you want? only your blessing for her hand. you have it, my lord. i can't tell you how happythat makes me. i need to speakwith you, father. it's urgent. - nothing is more urgent than war.- i agree. that's why i came to discussa solution for scotland. all this time we've been waitingfor mary tudor to give us england. to allow us the privilegeof putting your wife on the throne. but the english don't wait. they take what they want,just like they took calais from us. so i'm going to take it back. after that,i'll take all of england. we'll attack from scotlandin the north and calais in the south. when they wake up tomorrowto see french soldiers massing around calais,we might even get lucky. they might surrender to sparethemselves certain defeat. tomorrow? how could you...? i can't wait to see thelook on mary tudor's face when i claimthe english throne for myself. i just hope that sick cow liveslong enough for me to execute her. father, tomorrow? - what have you done?- can't you read? general brantome's men are movingnortheast from rouen as we speak. general brantome? i had to relieve laval.no imagination. no courage. stop babbling, father,and tell me the truth. - did you do this?- why wouldn't i? we don't have the strengthto take calais. our armies are spread too thin,all over europe! if we lose,and they capture our forces, they can stage an invasion andsweep down through france unopposed! but francis, we can't lose! yes, we can, and we will! father, thousands will die. you don't understand. \\\"blessed be the lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.\\\" i prayed for his guidance, and he spoke to mein a glorious waking dream. he said that i wouldclaim victory at calais! son, be happy with me! thanks to your father,you are going to rule half of europe! francis? what's the matter?you look like you've seen a ghost. i have.it's father, he's gone utterly mad. define \\\"utterly,\\\"because this is a man who's ridden a pigthrough the throne room in nothing but his under things. mother, he is starting a war. - what?- he's attacking calais. oh, francis. your father,is that what he told you? - it's all over his maps.- darling, relax. i've taken general lavalinto my confidence. he knows to do nothingwithout my approval. general laval has been dismissed. brantome's in charge now. who's brantome? oh, yes, i forgot. he's the new one henry brought in to replace laval when herefused to rename the fifth army \\\"god's gauls.\\\" don't worry, brantome's with us. all of these dismissed generals. i'm beginning to guesshow mary's uncle knows so much. what will you do when father realizesyour contravening all his orders? tomorrow he'll beinvading the spanish. the next day the dutch. when he starts rememberingwho he invaded yesterday, perhaps his wits will have returned, and this whole nightmarewill be over. darling, relax. if i left things to chance, we'd still be bowingto queen penelope. i promise, it's under control. for france's sake,i hope you're right. no. not yet. you know, we can stop all this. it worked.i've forgotten all about... you see, i can't even rememberwhat his name is anymore. good. there's still morethat i want you to forget. oh, in that case, i'll forget thatyou told me not to take off my skirt. that's not what i mean. i want you to forget... every boy who ever smiled at you. every man who ever flirted with you. everyone but me. were the guards necessary? surely a messengerwould have sufficed. i wanted to speak to you alone,away from your men. but not away from your men, i see. have you spoken with your father? the king will not agreeto the position you want. you never asked him, did you? we both know it was a fool's errand. there is something elsethat you want from me. are you going to tell me,or am i meant to guess? wise men look to the future. they're patient. when i started to buildmy army a decade ago, other men saw a ragtag rabble. i saw what it would become: a bargaining chipthat would one day bring kings to me, begging for favors. you never expected to befather's lord magistrate. you want to be mine, when i'm king,even if you have to be patient. i won't have to be patient for long,i don't think. is it poison, i wonder,that is driving him mad? i don't trust youand i don't like you. well, being liked is a king's job,not his lieutenant's. everything in me saysi should say no. and yet you are here...away from your wife. i think you knewyou might have to say yes, and she would object. she would pay any priceto save scotland, but would never ask you to. she knows how your familyfeels about me. well, you've just explainedto me why i love her. enough to have her lockedin a tower, i've heard. do you want this positionor don't you? i want the chanceto serve a great ruler. great rulers aren't afraid ofthe truth, no matter how painful. the truth is, you love your wife. the truth is, she needs me. so what will it be... my prince? when i am king,the position is yours. but i have one condition. your men will report to meas they would to you. - but why would you need my men to...- i'm going with you to scotland. well, that's unwise. and if you die,your promise to me is worth nothing. well, then,i suggest you keep me alive. are you serious? my uncle agreed? he'll send enough men to scotlandto quell the rebellion and save my mother? yes. i'd almost lost all hope. francis, how did you manage it? i convinced the dukethat it was in his best interests. - i'll explain when i'm back.- back? back from where? i am going with him to scotland. what? francis, no. mary, i have to. it's the only way that i canassure your mother's safety. and what of your safety? well, the duke getsnothing if i don't survive. with a man like that,i can't imagine a better guarantee. francis, i don't know what to say. you're saving my country,my mother, and you're risking your lifein the bargain. you needn't say anything. i've only kept my promise. as a king and a husband. you've done so much more than that. i'm not complaining, but... i thought you wantedto take things slowly. not anymore. i'm here now. out with it. there was never a baby. that took less time than i thought. please can i keep workinghere in the castle? i'll empty chamber pots,i'll muck stalls, anything. oh, stop groveling. as much as it warms me to hear it. i may have other uses for you. - other uses?- i have ladies, technically, they're my friends,none of whom i trust. because they're womenwho sleep with men for a cause. much like you did with the king. only it would be my cause. i promise you'll enjoy it morethan emptying chamber pots. i'm gonna send you toa lady i know in italy. you'll be taught proper manners,and the art of deception. and if you work hard, you may bewelcomed back in the castle as a member of my flying squad. this is where you thank me. thank you, your majesty. uh... that will need fixing, too. my family has owned successfulmines for generations, and i'd always hoped topass that expertise on to my son, but unfortunately,i've had only daughters. take the dumfries mine, it's returned 20 tonsof copper a week for years. a perfect investmentfor a man such as yourself. lord castleroy does quite wellin the spice industry, father. why would he want to invest in minesall the way over in scotland? you can't want me towaste lord castleroy's time explaining things that arebeyond your intelligence. do i have it wrong? i think you do, sir.quite wrong. i think you forget you're no longersimply addressing your daughter, but my future wife. and i'm sorry to say that'snot your first mistake. i've done research on your mines,and dumfries... has been played out for years. much like the rest of your holdings. now, let's look atsome different figures. as part of our marriage settlement,i will provide 10,000 francs to each of greer's sistersto be used as their future dowries. this will allow your daughtersto marry men of title and fortune, making you and your family wealthy. that is what you want, isn't it? uh... there is just one condition. greer will have final approvalover her sisters' marriages, so she can see to it thatthey marry men they love, not those forced on them. why are you doing this? a good businessman always knowswhat something is worth. and to me, greer is priceless. i never meant for youto go to war for me. when are you goingto realize that i love you, and i'll do anything for you? darling, let me be gratefulfor what you've done without making promisesyou can't keep. what you did was extraordinary. i think maybe when i return, you won't be the only onewaiting for me. you're suddenlyvery sure of yourself. i am. but just to be safe. look at me. am i the only one in this bedwith something to forget? what do you mean? when you're with me, i want to be the only oneinside your head. i want you to look into my eyesand see only me. i want you to alwaysremember what i feel like. so when you're using yourfingers for some other task, you wish they weretouching me instead. i will. i want you to always remember whatit feels like to be with your wife. ah, my wife and my son. closest family i have in this world. sharing my castle,my blood, my legacy. why would you lie to me? what do you mean? don't bother addingmore lies to the pile. i know what you've done.you've kept me caged up in this place like one of your song birds. sending in generals to humor me. don't blame mother when you've been hatching plans to attackhalf of europe. they aren't plans anymore! french forces marchedfor calais this morning. they're already halfway there. you think i'm delusional? read these dispatches. they aren't from anyof your performing generals. what happened to general brantome? i've sacked them all.we don't need any generals. not when we have a kingto lead our men. i leave tonight to join the invasion. oh, dear. no trousers. this keeps happening. i realize now that you twowere only trying to protect me. guarding my legacy. but that's my job, not yours. i will not be rememberedas king henry, ruler who dreamed of conquest. i'll be remembered asking henry, conqueror. greatest military strategistsince hannibal. henry, darling, you're not well. i have headaches!you know what else i have? the backing of god. francis, please,talk some sense into your father. it's too late.we can't stop the invasion. and anyway, father's right. what? we can take calais. any fool knows he can't do that. it's true, father's armywould fail on its own. but two armies. one marching head on. the other across this frozen marsh, flanking the english from behind. do you mean the duke's army?mary's army? mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that? my son, making history with me, just like i've always dreamed. i wanted to apologizefor my behavior earlier. i hope i wasn't out of line. it's my father who should beapologizing, though he never would. no one's ever stood up for me likethat before. or for my sisters. i was surprised to see how quietyou acted around your father. i've come to ratherenjoy your usual nature. outspoken, bold. how long have you knownthe truth about us? i've known for some time. as a businessman,i always do my research. but as a gentleman,i wasn't about to bring it up. and as your future husband,you should know i'm... too rich to care. i can't thank you enough. no need to thank me. everyone deserves a chanceto find happiness. just as i have. which brings me to this, i havesomething i'd like you to look over. but promise me you won't sign ituntil you're ready. this is our wedding contract. yes, and since you're now in charge of all marriagecontracts for your family, it means nothingwithout your approval. is something wrong? no, that felt surprisingly right. so you are takingmy mother's last hope, leaving her to the mercy ofthousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown. mary, please understand. i do understand. you're doing what you thinkis best for your country. not only my country. if france is beaten at calais,your country will suffer, too. - france can hardly defend scotland.- defend scotland? when have you ever defended scotland? except with brave words? - that is not fair.- now you want fair? we are rulers, not schoolchildren. blood will be spilled becauseof the choice you have made, - my mother's blood.- you don't know that. but the blood of thousandswould be spilled... - yes, french blood, i know.- i do not only think of france! no, you do not. but you do put her first. as any king would. then can you forgive me? it is myself i cannot forgive. i've made an awful mistake. our marriage was an awful mistake. please don't say that. there were a thousand momentswhere i could've done something. made secret treaties, sold favors, even snuck away to scotlandto be with those people who need me. and do you know why i didn't? because i love you. because i am your wife. mary, listen,when we have taken calais, the first thing i will dois travel to scotland with your uncle's army. we can still save your mother. like when you promised you wouldtake me to scotland with my brother? like when you promised soldiersthe time before that and the time before that? you make it sound like every promisei make is an empty one. what other promise can you make? you are the future king. it's not that simple. maybe it should be. for both of us. what does that mean? nothing. i don't know. i'm only going to asktwo things of you. the first is that youstop making me promises you know in your heartyou can't keep. and the other? come back to me. live through this battle. and don't let england cost me you. forward! have faith, mary.francis is clever and strong. he'll return home safely. i hope so. but even if he survives, our marriage is... what? francis is tryingto save his country, and i can forgive him for that, as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needsto be done for scotland, whatever that may be. what if he can't forgive you? well, that will just be too bad. i won't let him putmy country at risk again. watch any video online with open-subtitlesfree browser extension:  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[' enjoy all vod in high quality @ 4kvod.tvget live tv,movies,shows in one package gang vs. g-men planning: shigeru okada, tsune yabescreenplay: sakae sajima photography: yoshikazu yamazawasound: koichi iwata lighting: kenzo ginyaart director: hiromu kitagawa music: koichi kawabeeditor: kan suzukiasst. director: mikio koyama production asst.: eiji takedadeveloping\\u00ef\\u00bc\\\\x9atoei chemical industry starring koji tsuruta tatsuo umemiyashinichi chibayoshiko sakuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku spec', \\\"kuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku special joint investigation meeting hey, here they come! chief! what wasthe meeting about?

mary will have to understand. i have no choice. i need the duke's armyto save france. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwha\\\", \\\"ance. if we don't win this war, it won't matterwhat happens with mary's mother. england will have its waywith both our countries. father, if i do this,you have to cooperate. no more dismissing anyonewho disagrees. you will be a conqueror...but only if we work together. can you promise me that?
